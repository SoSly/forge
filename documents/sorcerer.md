## Sorcerer
Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.

Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.

Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.

Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

### Raw Magic
Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.

The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.

Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.

### Unexplained Powers
Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.

Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.

### Creating a Sorcerer
The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?

How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.

#### Quick Build
You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the _light_, _prestidigitation_, _ray of frost_, and _shocking grasp_ cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells _shield_ and _magic missile_. Finally, choose draconic bloodline as your sorcerous origin.

### Class Features
As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per sorcerer level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___

- **Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows
- **Tools:** None

___

\pagebreakNum

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (_a_) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (_b_) any simple weapon
- (_a_) a component pouch or (_b_) an arcane focus
- (_a_) a dungeoneer's pack or (_b_) an explorer's pack
- two daggers

### Innate Spellcasting
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 of the _Player's Handbook_ for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.

#### Strain
You do not have a pool of spell slots from which to cast your spells.  Instead, as the raw magic of your spells course through you, you must strain to channel and shape the magic. As the strain builds up, it warps and twists your body. As part of casting a spell of 1st-level or higher (or using an ability which requires a spell slot) you gain an amount of strain to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast the spell. Cantrips don't require spell slots, and thus don't cause strain. 

The amount of strain you can endure is limited based on your level as a Sorcerer, as shown in the strain limit column of the sorcerer table. You cannot cast a spell if it would result in you gaining strain in excess of this limit. You reduce your strain to 0 when you finish a long rest. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell you can cast. You cannot create a spell slot which exceeds this level, even if it would not exceed your strain limit.

##### Strain Cost
| Spell Level | Strain Cost |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1st |   2 |
| 2nd |   3 | 
| 3rd |   5 |
| 4th |   6 |
| 5th |   7 |

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

\columnbreak

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<center>

**Spell save DC =** 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br /> your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier =** your proficiency bonus +<br /> your Charisma modifier

</center>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the _Player's Handbook_) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

### Sorcerous Origin
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 2nd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Raw Magic
Beginning at 5th level, you can tap directly into the magical wellspring within you to bring forth raw magic, shaped to your will. As an action on your turn, you can cast a sorcerer spell which you don't already know. This spell must be of a level equal to or less than your max spell level, and you still gain strain based on the spell level.  Once you have used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 13 strain, raw magic flickers around you. You add your Charisma modifier to the damage roll of your sorcerer cantrips.

<div class="footnote">Variant Sorcerer | Homebrew by /u/damnedmage</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Lose Yourself
Beginning at 10th level, you are able to lose yourself in the flow of magic. You can attempt to create a spell slot to cast a sorcerer spell even if it would exceed your strain limit. In order to successfully cast the spell, you must make a Charisma check against a DC equal to 10 + the strain cost of the spell slot.  On a success, you cast the spell as normal.  On a failure, you gain a level of exhaustion.

Once you successfully cast a spell using this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Ancestral Spell
At 11th level, choose one 6th-level spell from the sorcerer spell list as an ancestral spell. You know the chosen spell, and it is included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table.  At higher levels, you learn additional spells in the same manner: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level.

Additionally, at 11th-level, you gain one 6th-level spell slot.  You gain additional spell slots at higher levels: one 7th-level spell slot at 13th level, one 8th-level spell slot at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell slot at 17th level.

Expended uses of your Ancestral Spell slots are regained when you finish a long rest.

### Power Unleashed
At 20th level, when casting a spell of 5th level or lower, you can create a spell slot of a level higher than 5th.  The Power Unleashed table summarizes the strain costs.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 35 strain, you can create 1st level spell slots without gaining strain.

##### Power Unleashed
| Spell Level | Strain Cost |
| :-: | :-: |
| 6th |   9 |
| 7th |  10 | 
| 8th |  11 |
| 9th |  13 |

## Sorcerous Origin
Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Choose from one of the many variations listed below.

### Divine Soul
Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.

A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.

\pagebreakNum

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

#### Divine Magic
Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells of a divine nature. Choose one 1st-level spell from the cleric spell list.  The chosen spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, and does not count against your number of spells known.

You learn an additional spell of a level you can cast from the cleric spell list at 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, and 9th level.

#### Favored by the Gods
Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 2 strain, you radiate an aura of divine favor.  Whenever you or a friendly creature within 5 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a +1 bonus. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

#### Channel Divinity
Beginning at 2nd level, you are able to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. You gain the Arcane Abjuration channel divinity option.

When you use your channel divinity, you choose which option to use.  You must then finish a short or long rest to use your channel divinity again.

Some channel divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your sorcerer spell save DC.

**Arcane Abjuration.** You use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures. As an action, you present your arcane focus, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Empowered Healing
Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 strain to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren't incapacitated and it doesn't exceed your strain limit. You can use this feature only once per turn.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 16 strain, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) at the start of your turn each round.

\columnbreak

#### Otherworldly Mantle
Starting at 14th level, you are able to briefly conjure spectral wings to bear you aloft. As a bonus action on your turn, you can conjure these wings, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your turn.  Whenever you fall, you descend 60 feet per round until you land, which you do safely. You choose the appearance of the wings, such as angelic or bat-like.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 32 strain, you are surrounded in a mantle of otherworldly power.  You have resistance to radiant and necrotic damage.

#### Unearthly Recovery
At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 35 strain, you manifest a halo of light.  If you would be reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, you are instead reduced to a number of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier, and you cannot benefit from this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Draconic Bloodline
Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor
At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor.  The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

##### Draconic Ancestry
| Dragon | Damage Type |
| :----- | :---------- |
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning   |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Lightning   |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
| White  | Cold        |

You can speak, read, and write Draconic and you gain advantage on Charisma checks made to influence dragons.

<div class="footnote">Variant Sorcerer | Homebrew by /u/damnedmage</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Draconic Hide
Also at 1st level, parts of your skin are covered in a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Constitution modifier.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 2 strain, your nails harden and extend like claws. These claws count as natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

#### Draconic Magic
Your draconic ancestry allows you to tap into your heritage.  You learn the *cause fear* spell.  Additionally, you learn an additional spell based on your draconic ancestry damage type, described below. These spells count as sorcerer spells for you, and do not count against your number of spells known.

You learn an additional spell based on your draconic ancestry damage type at 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, and 9th level.

___
- \* &nbsp;Unless you gain this spell from another source, damage dealt by these spells match your draconic ancestry damage type.
- \*\* This spell is found in [The Elementalist's Pocketbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11FW-bFnww8NMCNjL8ZIgB6VjLaHKgG8-/view)

#### Draconic Resilience
As magic flows through your body it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Beginning at 2nd level, your hit point maximum increases by 3 by another 1 whenever you gain a level in this class.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 3 strain, your scales begin to radiate with the energy of your draconic ancestor. Anyone who hits you with a melee attack takes damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry equal to half your Charisma modifier (rounded up).

<div class="footnote">Variant Sorcerer | Homebrew by /u/damnedmage</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Elemental Affinity
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 16 strain, you gain resistance to that damage type.

#### Draconic Might
At 14th level, your claws become as deadly as your magic.  As a bonus action on your turn, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can also make an unarmed attack against a creature you can see that is within range.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 32 strain, a pair of draconic wings sprout from your back. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet as long as you are unencumbered and not wearing heavy armor.

#### Draconic Presence
Beginning at 18th level, you can use a bonus action to _polymorph_ into an adult dragon of the type associated with your draconic ancestry.  The transformation takes your concentration as if it were a spell, and lasts for up to 1 hour, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. Your game statistics, except your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, are replaced by the statistics of the dragon.  You retain your alignment and personality, and any of the class features gained from the Sorcerer class.

You assume the hit points of your new form. When you revert to your natural form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.

You can take any action which a dragon can take, including speaking and casting spells.  Your gear melds into the new form. You can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from your equipment, except to cast spells with your components or arcane focus.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 35 strain, channel the dread presence of your draconic ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can gain 5 strain to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours

### Fae Touched
When a child is born by a fey crossing open at the full moon, had lord or lady of the fey smile upon them, or has a distant ancestor of a woodland nymph, they sometimes manifest as a sorcerer. These sorcerers are connected to the magic of the Feywild, a twilight realm of emotion and primal forces of nature that underlies the material plane, the barrier between the two worlds thin in many locations.

#### Sylvan Magic
Your link to the Feywild gives you a special connection to the primal forces of nature. You learn one 1st-level spell from the Fae Touched Spell List, below. The chosen spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, and does not count against your limit of spells known. When choosing your Sorcerer spells known at 1st level and higher, you can choose spells from this list, in addition to choosing spells from the Sorcerer spell list.

You learn an additional spell of a level you can cast from the Fae Touched Spell List at 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, and 9th level.

##### Fae Touched Spell List
| Spell Level | Spells Available
| :---: | :---------------
| 1st   | _faerie fire_, _goodberry_, _speak with animals_, _Tasha's hideous laughter_
| 2nd   | _calm emotions_, _flock of familiars_, _pass without trace_, _zone of truth_
| 3rd   | _bestow curse_, _conjure animals_, _nondetection_, _plant growth_
| 4th   | _compulsion_, _conjure woodland beings_, _grasping vine_, _hallucinatory terrain_
| 5th   | _dream_, _geas_, _mislead_, _tree stride_

</div>

#### Bright Eyes
Starting at 1st level, you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 2 strain, you can also see through magical darkness or through effects that cause things to be heavily obscured created by your own spells or abilities.

#### Tongue of Moon and Leaf
Also at 1st level, you also learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan, the song-like language of the fey.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 2 strain, your tongue glimmers silver. As a bonus action on your turn, you can choose a creature you can see. For the next minute, or until you use this ability on another target, you have advantage on all Charisma checks against that creature. After a creature is no longer influenced by this ability, they realize that you beguiled them with magic, and may grow hostile.

\pagebreakNum

#### Changeling Blood
Beginning at 2nd level, your connection to the feywild manifests as a spark of living magic in your flesh and blood.  When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by psychic damage or by a critical hit.

After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 3 strain, your eyes glow with a verdant light. You can automatically *detect magic* without casting the spell or requiring concentration.

#### Call the Wild Hunt
At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action on your turn, you can gain 3 strain to magically summon forth a black dog of the wild hunt to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the [dire wolf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dire-wolf) statistics, with the following changes:

- The black dog is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a fey, not a beast.
- It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.
- It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The black dog takes 5 necrotic damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- At the start of its turn, the black dog automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the black dog.

The black dog appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the black dog. On its turn, it can move only towards its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The black dog can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the black dog is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast.  The black dog disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.

\columnbreak

#### Leyline Travel
When you reach 14th level, you learn the fey's hidden means of using leylines, invisible channels of magic that flow through the natural world, to carry you and your friends vast distances instantly.

You learn the teleport spell if you don't already know it, which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you already know it, you can learn one sorcerer spell that doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known, obeying all the restrictions for selecting a spell at this level.

When you cast teleport, your innate connection to the leylines allows you to have a heightened accuracy with the spell. When the DM rolls 1d00 to determine if you have arrived at the chosen location successfully, the DM treats any roll of 49 or lower as 50.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 32 strain, you empower this feature, and gain the ability to take shorter jaunts along the leylines. On your turn, you can forfeit up to 30 feet of your movement to teleport that same distance. You must teleport to an unoccupied space you can see.

#### Majesty of the Feywild
Starting at 18th level, you can gain 6 strain as a bonus action to magically take on the guise of the true fey. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and necrotic damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 necrotic damage if you end your turn inside an object.

You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 35 strain, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, targets that are hit by an attack or fail a save as part of the spell are also Charmed or Frightened (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

> ##### Shadow Magic Sorcerer
> Instead of drawing power from the Feywild, you might retheme this same bloodline to represent innate magic from the Shadowfell itself.
>
> In that instance, you replace all instances of Necrotic damage with Radiant damage, and retheme these abilities to represent your connection to shadow. Instead of bright eyes, your eyes are dark as the night. Instead of summoning the wild hunt, you summon a hound of ill omen. Instead of transforming into a fey creature, you take on an umbral form.

### Starborn
The celestial bodies of the heavens work in mysterious ways, very occasionally granting power to individuals that bask in their light. Whether you were born in the wake of a falling star, viewed a solar eclipse without blinking away the dazzling light, or a nearby universe coalesced into the power that runs through your veins, the stars have gifted you with their elusive arcane power.

The Starborn instinctively know the paths of the stars, and draw power from their light. They use their connection with the heavens to seek guidance, read the future, and twist fate.

#### Star Magic
Your celestial ancestry allows you to tap into the magic of the stars.  You learn one 1st-level spell from Starborn Spell List, below.  The chosen spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, and does not count against your limit of spells known.  When choosing your Sorcerer spells known at 1st level and higher, you can choose spells from this list, in addition to choosing spells from the Sorcerer spell list.

You learn an additional spell of a level you can cast from the Starborn Spell List at 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, and 9th level.

#### Vision of the Stars
At 1st level, your connection to the stars grants you vision in the dark places.  You have darkvision to 60 feet, or 120 feet if you already have darkvision.  Additionally, you gain proficiency with one gaming set, such as dice or a deck of cards. You can use this gaming set as an arcane focus.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 2 strain, your eyes begin to shimmer with starlight. As a bonus action on your turn, you can choose a target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that target before the end of your next turn.

#### Star Reading
Beginning at 2nd level, your innate connection with the stars allows you to view the heavens and gain strength from them.  When you complete a long rest, you can make a star reading. Roll a 1d6, and for the next 24 hours you gain a benefit based on the constellation you have seen:

\columnbreak

1. *The Bull* grants advantage on Strength checks.
2. *The Cat* grants advantage on Dexterity checks.
3. *The Bear* grants advantage on Constitution checks.
4. *The Fox* grants advantage on Intelligence checks.
5. *The Owl* grants advantage on Wisdom checks.
6. *The Eagle* grants advantage on Charisma checks.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 3 strain, you shed light as a candle, and you gain the listed strain effect based on the constellation you have seen.

___
1. *The bull* doubles your carrying capacity.
2. *The cat* reduces damage from falling by 1d6.
3. *The bear* grants 1d6 temporary hit points each time you complete a short rest.
4. *The fox* adds half your proficiency bonus to any checks to recall lore or knowledge.
5. *The owl* increases your passive Perception by 5.
6. *The eagle* causes creatures which would normally be hostile to you to instead be unfriendly, unless they are already engaged in combat.

#### Bend Space
At 6th level, your cosmic reach allows you to collapse the distance between two points.  As an action, you can gain two strain to force a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, is magically teleported up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice which you can see.  A willing creature can choose to forgo the saving throw.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 16 strain, the space around you begins to warp.  As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can gain four strain to reduce the damage from this attack to 0, and magically teleport yourself into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see.

#### Stellar Divination
At 14th level, whenever you complete a short or long rest you may perform a ritual with your arcane focus, granting you insight into the future.  You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur before your next rest.  The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.  

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 32 strain, you begin to see and manipulate the possibilities around you.  Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you rolls an attack, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to gain 2 strain and grant advantage on the triggering roll.

#### Perfect Fortune
At 18th level, your ability to view and alter your destiny is nearly absolute.  You have advantage on Initiative checks, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on saving throws against spells or effects which include you as a target.

**Strain.** As long as you have at least 35 strain, you can extend your revision of destiny to others near you. Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can spend 2 strain to grant advantage or disadvantage (your choice) to the roll.

> ### Why a Sorcerer Variant?
> As written, the sorcerer of the Player's Handbook isn't *bad*, per se.  It's mechanically and thematically "acceptable".  The problem is, it isn't actually interesting.  It has stolen the ideas of other, better classes and tried to kitbash them together in some limited form that just results in a class which is overwhelmingly average.
>
> During the original playtest packets of D&D Next (now D&D 5e), Sorcerer had a far more interesting life, however.  It wasn't a dramatic shift from the Sorcerer of today, but it was something unique, something special which emphasized the raw, barely controlled nature of the sorcerer's theme.  It wasn't about what you know, it was about how much control you had.  And the more you used, the more dangerous you became.
>
> This is an attempt to recapture that feel, to put Sorcerer back on a pedestal of "Awesome" where it can stand beside Warlocks, Wizards, and Bards and say "Yes, I really do belong here."
>

>
> ### Design Goals
> - The Sorcerer must be a "full caster" arcane spellcasting class which fills a unique niche, separate from Bard, Psion, Warlock, and Wizard.
> - The Sorcerer must not rely on the crutch of "metamagic" as its defining feature.
> - The Sorcerer must emphasize the raw and barely controlled nature of their magical power.
> - The Sorcerer must have a risk and reward mechanic inherent in their means of casting magic.
> - The Sorcerer must not exceed the Bard's limit of spells known.
> - The Sorcerer must fit on no more than 4 pages, including artwork.  Sorcerous Origins must take up no more than 1 to 2 pages.
>
> \columnbreak
>
> ### Design Notes
> **Version 0.9.2 (19th January 2020)**
>
> The basic premise of the sorcerer is that it gains strain to cast and modify spells, and the more they are strained, the weirder they become.
>
> When designing a new Sorcerous Origin, there are a few key points to keep in mind:
> - Sorcerers have an extremely limited spell selection. Every subclass should provide them with an additional spell known at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level. Similar to a Cleric's domain spells, these spells should reinforce the theme of their sorcerous origin, and need not be limited to the Sorcerer Spell List.
> - Most of the features of a Sorcerous Origin are in fact two features in one: a power or utility feature which provides a measure of power, and a ribbon which is activated when a certain amount of strain has been gained.  As a guideline, these should activate when the user has about half their strain limit when they gain the feature.
> - Sorcerous Origin features should aim to provide utility or defenses to the sorcerer.  They should not (generally) improve a Sorcerer's damage.
>
> ### Changelog
> - 0.9.2 (19th January 2020) - Fixed the wording of Ancestral Spell so that Sorcerers can choose to replace the spell learned at higher levels.
> - 0.9.1 (13th January 2020) - Changed Fey bloodline spell list to a static list, rather than partial Druid spell list.
> - 0.9.0 (2nd December 2019) - Redesigned Fey bloodline.  Removed Calming Release. Moved secondary Sorcerous Origin features from 3rd level to 2nd.
> - 0.8.0 (7th August 2019) - Added Starborn bloodline
> - 0.7.7 (23rd July 2019) - Changed the wording of Strain-based casting to allow the creation of slots for abilities other than casting spells (for use with Paladin smite interaction).
> - 0.7.6 (12th July 2019) - Added a minimum to the temporary hit points gained by the strain effect of the 6th level Empowered Healing ability for the Divine Soul origin.
