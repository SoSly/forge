## Preface
Honestly, I didn't mean to compile a whole book of content.  We just kept making more, and one day I realised I was finding it hard to sort through everything in my binder, because it was so disorganized.  I tried to organize it, but the tools at hand just weren't good enough, and frankly it was tedious, so here we are.   The contents in this book represent a labor of love; a collection of dozens of brilliant ideas all made by us with the goal of good, silly fun.  Thank you all for your help.  I can't wait to see what we make next.

# Chapter 1 <span>Races</span>

Across the many planes and multiverses exists a cornucopia of races, all wildly different and varied and unique. This chapter presentse character races that are some of the more distinctive races options in the {dungeons-and-dragons} multiverse. They supplement the options in the _Player's Handbook_ and are mroe rare in the worlds of D&D than the races in that book are.

The following races are detailed in this chapter:
___
**Tibbits** are the descendants of the most common wizards' familiars: cats, able to take the form of small humans.

This chapter also contains new subraces for some existing races: **Lythari Elf**.

At the end of the chapter is a section you can use to determine the height and weight of a character who is a member of any one of the races in this chapter.

## Elf
Most elves belong to the three most common subraces: high elves, wood elves, and drow. The Lythari are a new option for an elf's subrace, in addition to those found in the _Player's Handbook_.

### Lythari
The reclusive lythari (originally Ly-tel-quessir), known among the wood elves as silver shadows, are true lycanthropes: good-aligned elves capable of changing into lupine form.

#### Lythari Subrace Traits
The lythari subrace has the elf traits in the _Player's Handbook_, plus the subrace traits below.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Damage Reduction.*** Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered is reduced by 1.

***Shapechanger.*** You can use your action to polymorph into a wolf. You can revert to your true form, that of an elf, by using a bonus action on your turn. Your statistics, other than listed below, are the same in each form. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for a wolf to wear a piece of equipment, based on its shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the new form has no effect until you leave the form. You revert to your true form if you die.

\columnbreak

<p></p>

_Bite Attack._ While in wolf form, your bite is a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage for a normal unarmed strike. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can only knock a creature prone with your bite attack once per turn.

_Fast Movement._ While in wolf form, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

_Keen Hearing and Smell._ While in wolf form, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

_Natural Armor._ While in wolf form, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

***Wolf Tongue.*** Wolves and dogs can understand your speech, and you have the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most wolves and dogs lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you friendship with wolves or dogs, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

## Tibbit
Tibbits (also known as catweres) are small, humanoid creatures that have the ability to turn into a common house cat. They arose from felines kept as familiars in ages past. The powerful magic that allows a familiar to gain intelligence and magic abilities slowly filtered from one generation of cats to the next. Whether tibbits evolved from a natural process, divine intervention, or a sudden surge in the magic running through their ancestry, none can say. Tibbits have never existed in large numbers, and their tendency to spread across the world leaves them with a fractured, incomplete racial history.

Much like their feline ancestor, catfolk exhibit independence, curiosity, and quickness of mind and body. They rarely form communities larger than two or three families, and even these small colonies rarely hold together for more than a few years. Shortly after reaching adulthood, a tibbit develops an intense desire to wander the world and satisfy her racial curiosity. Tibbits can be found wherever humans and other civilized humanoid races have established cities, towns, and colonies.

Among humans and other humanoids tibbits usually remain in their cat form. The stray cat that prowls a neighborhood, the mangy cat adopted as a temple's unofficial pet, and the lazy feline always close at hand at the local tavern might be tibbits. Driven by curiosity, tibbits love to remain in their animal form while observing humans.

\columnbreak

Cynical observers contend that a tibbit seeks to spy on others. Tibbits hold that they merely like to keep an ear and eye out for any interesting bits of news. Tibbits are typically too chaotic, carefree, and impulsive to work as spies or hired killers. Upon overhearing a group of adventurers talking over a treasure map in hushed tones, a tibbit might be just as likely to shift into humanoid form on the spot and offer to join the adventure as she is to lose interest and chase down a juicy mouse she spotted across the tavern.

### The Lap of Luxury
Tibbits, as befits their heritage, are moody, curious, and sometimes arrogant. Many tibbits prefer the comforts of a fine meal (whether a succulent rodent or a five-course feast in the lap of luxury), stiff drink, and a soft couch. Even the most decadent tibbit, however, eventually succumbs to the steady pull of its curiosity. A tibbit might spend years living off the treasures it won in adventure, only to suddenly strike out into the unknown once again.

When dealing with others, tibbits show a similar capability to change their attitudes and posture depending on their moods. A tibbit might act relaxed and languid one moment, alert and inquisitive the next. They tend to have a slightly distant, arrogant attitude toward others, as if as a race they share a colossal, secret joke over other intelligent creatures. Still, once a tibbit marks someone as a friend few other creatures match their devotion. A tibbit might complain about a friend's needs or tend toward laziness, but when trouble arises she is a dauntless ally.


### Feline Features
In humanoid form, tibbits are small, stealthy, dark-skinned people with pointed ears and catlike eyes. Their hair tends to grow thick and long and males tend to grow sideburns. Their skin tones range from a tawny brown to black, but occasionally a tibbit has pure white skin. Their hair color matches the wide range of colors found in house cats, from pure white to striped silver to deep black.

In their cat form, tibbits look like fat but energetic house cats. They appear identical to—and indistinguishable from—any common, domesticated breed.

### Curiouser and Curiouser
Tibbits tend to regard other folk with a detached sense of bemusement. Much of their lore and common wisdom regarding men, dwarves, and elves filters through their guise as house cats. Thus, tibbits see how other races act when they think no one else is around. To a tibbit, every intelligent creature is a bundle of secrets just waiting to unfurl before them.

<div class=footnote>Part 1 | Races</div>

\pagebreakNum

<p></p>

In general, tibbits find humanity's ambition, drive, and fiery passion intriguing. They consider dwarves overly dour. Elves strike them as kindred spirits, as tibbits appreciate that the long-lived races share a similar tendency to see issues from different perspectives. They adore gnomes and halflings and many good-aligned tibbits adopt such folk. More than one kobold or goblin party has descended upon a sleepy gnome village or halfling caravan only to find an enraged tibbit wizard waiting for them. Gnome and halfling folk who have benefited from such welcome surprises have strong traditions of taking care of stray cats and treating their feline pets as treasured companions.

### Natural Explorers
Tibbits have no lands of their own. Instead, they dwell within civilized territories established by other folk. Any civilization that keeps domesticated cats likely houses colonies of tibbits within its cities.

Few tibbits make their identity openly known once they settle in an area. A tibbit is much more likely to remain in cat form as she travels through a city, although she usually keeps a well-hidden, luxurious apartment hidden in an out-of-the-way corner of town. Many tibbits become petty thieves, raiding pantries for fine foods, liquor, and other creature comforts.

Tibbits who travel the land might keep their humanoid guise to make dealings with other creatures easier. Even these tibbits prefer to pass themselves off as travelers from other planes, and they rarely publicize their ability to change shape.

\columnbreak

### Tibbit Names
Tibbits tend to adopt names based on their physical traits and deeds. A tibbit kitten is given a nickname by her parents or her master, one that reflects her temperament and appearance. When a tibbit comes of age she adopts a name of her choice. Tibbits tend to pick names from other folk, usually based solely on the sound.

Strangers and business partners use the name a tibbit picks for herself, while the tibbit's close friends and family use the original nickname chosen by her parents. A tibbit allows only her closest friends to learn and use her nickname. A nontibbit given such a privilege has received one of the highest honors a tibbit can grant to an outsider.

As a tibbit travels the world, she adopts a surname that reflects her experiences and important deeds. A tibbit usually changes her surname after such an event, but her true name uses all of her adopted surnames from childhood onward, and not just her latest one. When two tibbits meet, they share these long-form names to express their pasts with one another.

<p></p>

In general, tibbit names work for either sex. Whether male or female, a tibbit who has a short tail in cat form likely ends up with the nickname "Spiketail."

***Parent-Bestowed Names:*** Blackpaw, Glittereye, Longear, Patchfur, Quickfang, Tumblepaw.

### Adventurous
The life of an adventurer comes naturally to a tibbit, as her curiosity pushes her ever onward. While many tibbits satisfy this drive with travel to civilized areas and exploration of a city's corners, some tibbits want more out of life. "Adventurer" is seen as a respected occupation among tibbits, and they have a natural fascination for adventurers of other races. In some cases, a tibbit in cat form takes to following an adventuring band, concealing its true nature until an opportune moment. A tibbit fighter might spring from cat to humanoid form in time to drive off a group of orcs that threatens the party's camp. In this manner, tibbits prove their valor and demonstrate their unmatched stealth in hopes of winning a place with their unwitting comrades.

### Tibbit Traits
Your tibbit character has a number of traits in common with all other tibbits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** A tibbit reaches adulthood at the age of 16, and generally lives into the middle of his second or third century.

***Alignment.*** Tibbits have a strong tendency toward chaos and an equally strong lethargy toward moral issues, making the majority of them chaotic neutral. Carefree, decadent, and given to long periods of wallowing in luxury, tibbits can be maddeningly self-centered. Some tibbits tend toward proactive freedom-seeking, marking chaotic good as their second most common alignment. Such tibbits share many of their neutral brethren's tendencies, but a righteous struggle or a chance to spring a trap on evildoers rouses them to action.

***Size.*** Tibbits average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Escape Artist.*** Tibbits have advantage on checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple or the restrained condition.

***Feline Transformation.*** You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a house cat. You can remain in this form indefinitely, and only revert to your natural form when you are rendered unconscious. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of a cat, but you retain your hit points, alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies.
-  You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to those actions which a cat may take. Transforming does not break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if a cat is physically capable of doing so.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for a cat to wear a piece of equipment, based on its shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the new form has no effect until you leave the form.

***Keen Senses.*** You gain proficiency in Perception.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and you can speak and understand Feline. The Feline language, a strange combination of purrs, hisses, and empathic transfers, allows tibbits to communicate with cats of all forms. Tibbits are born with the knowledge of this language.

***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

\columnbreak

***Subrace.*** The two main kinds of tibbits, alley cats and domestics, refer more to whether the tibbit was raised in a Wizard's tower, or on the streets.

#### Alley Cat
As an Alley Cat, you have lived your life largely as one of exploration and curiosity, unfettered by any master or calling. You're inclined to boldness, independence, and perhaps a bit of overconfidence.

Alley Cats are more prone to wander than other tibbits, rarely settling in one place for long as they constantly seek a better patch of sunlight to rest in.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Free Spirit.*** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

***Scavenger:*** Starvation is no stranger; you require food half as often as a normal character.

#### Domestic
As a domestic, you were raised in the care of a wizard. You learned to respect his studious nature, and were well cared for during most of the days. Your master's constant thirst for knowledge only fueled your own curiosity, granting you insight into secrets other tibbits wish they understood, and your constant exposure to magic gave you an inherent resistance to it.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Arcane Infusion.*** You know the *prestidigitation* cantrip.

***The Art of Laziness.*** You are used to taking short naps throughout the day whenever you can get the opportunity. You are able to complete a short rest in half the time, and after resting for at least 4 hours throughout the course of a day, you can gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. You may still only benefit from one long rest in any twenty-four hour period.

## Fighter

## Martial Archetypes

### Cerebral Commander
Where the mystic focuses on studying psionics and unlocking the mysteries of the mind, the cerebral commander simply uses his mental prowess to spur others into battle.  A cerebral commander blends psionics and martial prowess together harmoniously, becoming a fierce and effective leader.

#### Psionics
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to use psionic powers.  See the Psionic Disciplines section of the _Psionics Handbook_ for the general rules of using powers.

***Talents.*** You learn one talent of your choice.  You learn an additional talent of your choice at 7th and 10th level.

***Psi Points.*** The Cerebral Commander Psionics table shows how many psi points you have to use your discipline effects.  The table also shows your psi limit. You regain all expended psi points when you finish a long rest.

***Disciplines Known.*** You know the Mantle of Command discipline.

The Disciplines Known column of the Cerebral Commander Psionics table sh ows when you learn more disciplines.

In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.

***Psionics Ability.*** Wisdom is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You can use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline, or when making an attack roll with one.

<center>

## Monk

## Monastic Traditions

### Way of the Beast Eaters
It is said that those who follow the ways of the beast eaters have forsaken the very essence of mortality in exchange for untold power. A beast eater absorbs the power of the monsters they have slain, but many would argue they have sacrificed their own soul to do so. A beast eater bites with the sharpness of the wolf, strikes with the swiftness of the adder, and lashes out with the stinger of the scorpion, fueling strange and powerful magics with their ki.

A beast eater may spend as much time among the beasts he consumes as he does in civilization, and is equally adept at navigating either field, allowing him to go unnoticed until he summons forth the dread powers at his command.

#### Beast Lore
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn rituals which allow you to cast spells or monster abilities. Beast eaters refer to both spells and monster abilities as lore, and you must go out of your way to learn new lore during your adventures.

***Basic Lore.*** You learn 3 cantrips selected from the Sorcerer spell list. You learn another cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

In place of cantrips, you can learn "basic monster abilities", which are weapon attacks taken from any beast with a CR less than 1. When you take the Attack Action on your turn, you may choose to use a basic monster ability instead of your weapon or unarmed attack, using your Wisdom modifier for the attack and damage roll. Basic monster abilities do not expend any ki or spell slots.

***Lore Costs.*** To cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of ki equal to the Spell's level. To use a monster ability, you must expend a number of ki equal to the monster's CR.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a beast lore spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. The maximum number of ki points (its base ki point cost plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell is 2. This maximum increases to 3 at 7th level, 4 at 13th level, and 5 at 17th level. You are never limited in the number of ki you can spend to activate a monster ability.

> ##### Basic Monster Abilities
> In most cases, basic monster abilities are interesting and flavorful, such as an Ape's "rock", or a Crocodile's "bite". DMs are advised against allowing the use of the Giant Wasp's sting in their games as it deals more damage than intended.

\columnbreak

<p></p>

***Gaining Lore.*** As you encounter new experiences, you are granted access to lore. In order to learn a new spell or monster ability, you must first experience the effects of that spell or monster ability by being targeted by it, or by being in the spell or ability's area of effect. During a short or long rest, you may learn a new lore that you have experienced in the past 24 hours.

The Lore Known column of the Beast Eater Lore table shows how many spells or monster abilities you can learn. The Maximum Spell Lore column determines the maximum level of spell you may learn, and the Maximum Monster Lore column determines the maximum CR of a creature from which you can gain lore.

If you have already learned your maximum amount of lore, you can choose to forget a lore you know in order to replace it with a new lore. If you experience a cantrip, or a weapon attack from a beast whose CR is less than 1, you may choose to replace one of your basic lore with these abilities.

***Casting Lore.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your lore spells, since its power is drawn from your ki. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a lore spell or ability you cast, and when making an attack roll with one.


<center>

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br />your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + <br />your Wisdom modifier
</center>

#### Monster Affinity
Also at 3rd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. If you lack proficiency in the required skill, you are treated as having it only for the purposes of these monster knowledge checks, but your proficiency bonus is not doubled.

#### Infusion
At 6th level, you gain the ability to consume the monsters you fight to gain even more of their power. You can attempt to learn a monster's passive abilities (movement, natural armor, damage resistances, senses, save or skill proficiencies, languages, and special traits) in a manner similar to how you gain Lore.

To gain an infusion, you must first experience that ability by attempting to consume a part of the monster who possesses it. You must eat enough of the monster to constitute a meal as a part of a short rest. Once you have done so, you learn one of the monster's passive abilities as an infusion.

The Infusions Known column of the Beast Eater Lore table determines how many infusions you may know. You are still limited to creatures whose CR does not exceed your Maximum Monster Lore.

A beast eater's form often changes to reflect the abilities learned. If you gain the natural base armor 14 of the Galeb Duhr, then your skin might take on a rocky appearance.

#### Consumption
By 11th level, through your study of spells and monsters, you gain the ability to consume the magic thrown against you, and turn it back on its creator. If you are targeted by a spell, or in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to make a Wisdom check against a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell fails and has no effect.

Until the end of your next turn, you know the spell that you have consumed and can cast it with your own ki, even if the spell requires more ki to cast than you are normally allowed to spend on a spell at your level.

Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest.

#### Assimilation
At 17th level, you have learned to absorb not only a monster's powers, but the monster itself. As an action, you can touch a creature and attempt to absorb it. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your lore save DC. On a failed saving throw, the target is banished to a demiplane associated with your existence, and you are transformed into that creature.

The target remains there for up to ten minutes, or until it escapes or you fall unconscious. The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes and the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the nearest unoccupied space next to you.

While transformed into the target, you gain the target's appearance and all of its equipment, and your statistics and ability scores become those of the target, except for your Hit Points, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores. You may use any of the creature's abilities or powers as if you were that creature.

Once you have used this ability, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

## Rogue

## Rogueish Archetypes
At 3rd level, a rogue gains the Roguish Archetype feature. The following options are available to a rogue, in addition to those offered in the _Player's Handbook_: the Sensate.

### Sensate
The breeze that caresses the face brings with it a cooling balm and scent traces that trigger memories of old. The flavor of the fruit plucked from the tree is tart but sweet, and the sticky juice explodes in the mouth with a texture just as important as taste. The voices of the choir are rough but earnest, and they speak of experiences hidden in the melody that only a sensate can separate from the mix and appreciate.

#### Heightened Senses
Starting at 3rd level, your sense of smell, hearing, and touch intensify. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks which rely on your sense of smell, hearing or touch, and can track by your sense of smell.

Additionally, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Joie de Vivre
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your cheerful optimism and willing curiosity inspires hope in your allies. As a reaction, you may grant a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to an ally when they make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

#### Sense Link
Starting at 9th level, you are able to share your senses with another creature, and experience their senses as if they were your own. As an action on your turn, you may touch a creature to link with them. As an action, you or the creature you are linked with can experience through one another's senses (see through the other's eyes, hear what the other hears, etc.) until the start of your next turn.

\columnbreak

<p></p>

As long as you remain on the same plane with the creature, this link will not break or end. You may only be linked with one creature at a time. If you link with a new creature, the link with the first will end immediately.

#### Seen it Before
Also at 9th level, you become skeptical to things that are out of place. You have Advantage on any saving throws or ability checks made to identify or see through an illusion.


#### Intensify Sensation
By 13th level, you have a keen understanding of the sensations of those around you, as well as your own. As a bonus action, choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice) for the next minute:

- Vulnerability to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage.
- Disadvantage on Saving Throws.
- Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### See it Again
When you reach 17th level, you are able to recast a spell from another spellcaster. Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to cast that spell, yourself. When you cast the spell, you may choose the target or area affected as normal. Your Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. The spell is cast at the same level as it was cast against you.

Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you have finished a long rest.

## Wizard

## Arcane Traditions
At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition feature. The following options are available to a wizard, in addition to the options offered in the _Player's Handbook_: School of Theology.

### Theology
Students of the school of Theology are wizards who have turned their study to the divine. These scholars seek out and collect esoteric sources of divine lore, wherever those sources might be. Theologians are not always tied to a specific deity, but they do acknowledge that some of their power may be divinely fueled, as they draw upon the rituals and prayers used by the faithful.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you study the tradition of theology at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Religion skill. If you are already trained in Religion, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency.

#### Theology Savant
Your study of divine magic allows you to learn spells from the cleric class.

Starting at 2nd level, each level when your Spellcasting feature lets you add two new spells to your spellbook, you can choose to add one new spell from the cleric spell list or the wizard spell list. Your other spell must still be from the wizard spell list, and you must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell. This spell becomes a wizard spell for you.

In addition, when you find a cleric spell scroll or text of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level you can prepare, and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a cleric spell into your spellbook follows the same rules as those required for a wizard spell, and any spell you copy into your spellbook in this way becomes a wizard spell for you.

You can prepare any cleric spells added to your spellbook via this feature as you would any other wizard spell.

#### Arcane Censure
Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to impose your arcane censure upon them. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the triggering attack has disadvantage, and attack rolls against them have advantage until the end of the creature's next turn. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have completed a short or long rest.

#### Magical Secrets
At 10th level, you learn may add two spells of your choice from any class to your spellbook. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Wizard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as wizard spells for you.

\columnbreak

#### Divine Utterance
At 14th level, you have learned secrets which were not meant to be learned without the protection of a divine agent. As a bonus action on your turn, you can utter these divine secrets to a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see and which can hear you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded, deafened, and incapacitated for 1 minute. At the end of its turn, the creature can reattempt the saving throw.

Once you have used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Variant Features
Each class in {dungeons-and-dragons} gains features at particular levels.  Here, you'll find features that replace or enhance the normal features of your character's class.  The class feature variants each specify which feature they replace or enhance.  If a feature is replaced, you gain no benefit from it and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it. If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.

Your DM decides which of these options are available to the characters in a campaign.  A DM is free to prohibit these variants, allow all of them, or make a subset of them available to you.

### All Classes
All characters have access to the following features.

#### Fighting Styles
_Fighter, paladin, and ranger feature (enhances Fighting Style)_

##### Zweihander Reach

#### Skill Points
_1st-level feature (enhances Proficiencies)_

You gain a number of skill points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0). These points can be spent to gain additional proficiencies, according to the Skill Point Costs table, below.

| Tool expertise | 2 |
| Weapon proficiency | 1 |

If you gain additional skill points due to a permanent increase in your Intelligence, you may spend them at that point.  Skill points cannot be lost once gained.

#### Savage Retaliation
_2nd-level Barbarian feature (replaces Reckless attack)_

Every time you make a melee attack, whether the attack hits or misses, you can choose to mark your target. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn.

#### Songbook
_1st-level bard feature (enhances Spellcasting)_

You have a spellbook like a Wizard, and record your known bard spells in this spellbook.  You prepare spells a number of spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your bard level (minimum of one spell) from this book, exactly as a wizard does.

### Cleric

#### Channel Divinity: Divine Prayer
_2nd-level Cleric feature (replaces Turn Undead)_

### Fighter

#### Combat Challenge
_2nd-level Fighter feature (replaces Action Surge)_

Every time you make a melee attack, whether the attack hits or misses, you can choose to mark your target. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn. While a target is marked by you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a target. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.

The first time a creature you have marked that is within reach of your weapon moves or makes an attack that does not include you, you can make an opportunity attack against that creature without expending your reaction.

\columnbreak

#### Roll with It
_1st-level Fighter Feature (replaces Second Wind)_

You have learned to roll with the punches and shake off the worst damage. As a reaction whenever you take damage, you can reduce the damage taken by a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Monk

### Paladin
A paladin has access to the following features.

#### Divine Sanction
_2nd-level Paladin feature (replaces Divine Smite)_

As a bonus action on your turn, you mark one target you can see that is within 30 feet of you. While a target is marked by you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a target. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.

When a creature you have marked makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target. This damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

The mark expires if you use this ability to mark a different creature. The mark also ends if you make an attack against a creature other than the target of the mark, unless you have also attacked your target during this turn, or are adjacent to the target.

### Ranger
A ranger has access to the following features

#### Prepared Spellcasting
_2nd-level Ranger feature (enhances spellcasting)_

You no longer select spells known when you level up as a Ranger.  Instead, you can prepare a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + 1/2 your ranger level (minimum of one spell) from the Ranger spell list, exactly as a Paladin does.

<div class=footnote>Part 1 | Customization Options</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Warlock
A warlock has access to the following features.

### Wizard
A wizard has access to the following features.

#### Cantrip Versatility
_1st-level Wizard feature (enhances Cantrips)_

You record your cantrips in your spellbook just like any other spell.  You begin play by adding 4 cantrips to your spellbook from the Wizard spell list.  You must prepare your cantrips in order to cast them, just as your other spells; however, these do not count against your usual spell preparation limit. Instead, you may prepare a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.

Adding a new cantrip to your spellbook takes 8 hours, and costs 25 gp.  The cost represents the material components you expend as you experiment with the cantrip to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.  Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the cantrip just like your other cantrips.

## Masterwork Items
Anyone with sufficient training, time, and resources can craft weapons, armor, and tools.  However, many craftsmen spend years of their life practicing their trade in the hopes of crafting perfection.  Sometimes, they achieve greatness, and create an item of surpassing quality.

Masterwork weapons, armor, and tools provide a bonus based on their rarity.  Masterwork implements provide bonuses based on their type (attack and damage rolls for weapons, AC for armor, and relevant ability checks for tools).

An uncommon (+1) masterwork item is typically the greatest a smith will achieve in their lifetime.  These are nearly perfect in every way: light, strong, well-balanced, durable.  They are truly impressive, but not the stuff of legends.

A rare (+2) masterwork item surpasses the work of even talented smiths. Items of this quality may take years to forge, and most have storied pasts.  These are the pinnacle of what a mortal smith can achieve without magical assistance.

Very rare (+3) masterwork items are the stuff of legends.  They are perfect in every way; flawless works of art that surely must have required a bit of magic just to forge.

The value of a masterwork item is based on its rarity.  To determine the value of a masterwork item, add the base item cost to the appropriate value from the Mastework Items table, below.

<div class=masterwork>

##### Masterwork Items
| Item | Uncommon Cost | Rare Cost | Very Rare Cost |
| :--- | :--: | :-: | :-: |
| Simple weapons | 100 gp | 1,000 gp | 10,000 gp |
| Martial weapons | 200 gp | 2,000 gp | 20,000 gp |
| Armor | 500 gp | 5,000 gp | 50,000 gp |
| Tools | 50 gp | 500 gp | 5,000 gp |

</div>

Masterwork weapons are not magical, and do not bypass magical resistances.  Magical weapons, in turn, are frequently also masterwork, but always contain at least some magical properties which allows them to bypass resistance.

Magical items are frequently also masterwork, although it isn't required, but a magical item which provides only a statistical bonus is never magical.  For example, a masterwork longsword is just masterwork, but a _masterwork glowing longsword_ is both masterwork and a common magical item.  When pricing such items, add the price of masterwork to the price of the item.  If it costs 100 gp to add the _glowing_ property to a weapon to make it magical, then a _masterwork glowing longsword_ should cost about 300 gp.

## Spell Descriptions
The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Animate Dead
_3rd-level necromancy_

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or the corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range.  Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).  This creature is proficient with any armor or weapons you provide them, but cannot activate magical items or use complex tools.

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command a creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you.  You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.  If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, or until you cast this spell again to animate a new creature, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it and becomes indifferent to you. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature gains multiattack and can make a number of attacks equal to one-third of the spell's level (rounded up).  Zombies created by this spell gain 10 extra hit points for each slot level above 3rd, as well as +1 to hit and damage for every two slot levels above 3rd.  Skeletons created with this spell gain 5 extra hit points for each slot level above 3rd, as well as +1 to hit and damage for every slot level above 3rd.

You may continue in this way until you miss, or until the die size is 1d4.

The spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the initial damage is 1d8.  The damage increases again to 1d10 at 11th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.
