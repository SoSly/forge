<h2 id="house-rules">House Rules</h2>
<p>The following house rules are in effect across my games.  This content may change regularly; a changelog is recorded at the end of the document with dates so that you can easily see when the rules change.  If a rule is not on this page, we are not using it. This document is also accompanied by my <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Lylz1TyxRNCSgbjvQXF">Nivenomicon</a>, which contains homebrew and variant content.</p>
<h3 id="ability-scores">Ability Scores</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LmjT90YiBkHJzNKzWTh">23/25/27</a> method for generating ability scores.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LEFSuc0n5Q8GSzz_ye_">Skill Points</a> are awarded for high Intelligence scores…</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Artificer is not permitted, but I will consider alternatives.</li>
<li>Bards have access to the “Bladesinger” cantrips.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LcSVrh7Cy4j7eUH7Z_-">Sorcerer</a> has been replaced.</li>
<li><a href="https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UAMystic3.pdf">Mystic</a> is allowed with caveats (talk to me).</li>
<li>Warlocks may use Intelligence or Charisma (chosen at character creation) as their Spellcasting ability score.</li>
<li>Monks regain their spent <em>ki</em> with only a few minutes of meditation as part of a short rest, rather than 30 minutes. See “Short Rest”, below.</li>
<li>The following new classes are available for play: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J1bshfjrYiGjn_d8D3gD3hy3wTeE2k7v/view">Swordmage</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following new combat actions are available from the DMG pgs 271-272: Climb onto a Bigger Creature, Disarm, Overrun, Shove Aside.</li>
<li>“Facing” (DMG pg. 252) is in use. Additionally, whenever another character moves, you may choose to use your reaction to change your facing as often as you want until the end of the current turn.</li>
<li>Drinking a potion is a bonus action. Administering a potion is an action.</li>
<li>At the beginning of your turn, you may choose to declare that your turn will take place at a lower initiative.  You cannot declare an initiative lower than 1. Your entire turn (and all future turns) instead takes place on the newly declared initiative count.</li>
<li>A natural 1 does not guarantee a miss. A natural 20 does not guarantee a hit.</li>
<li>When you engage in Two-weapon Fighting, you do not expend your bonus action. You can still gain the benefits of Two-weapon Fighting only once per turn.</li>
<li>When you are reduced to 0 hit points, use the <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LyVcNsbEC0RfPpLS-Hr">Last Stand</a> rules.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="experience-and-levels">Experience and Levels</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must roll to determine hit points at each new level.  I will also roll for your hit points, secretly.  You may choose whether to take your roll or my roll, but you cannot know my roll until you have decided.</li>
</ul>
<div class=column-break></div><h3 id="equipment-and-treasure">Equipment and Treasure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use variant encumbrance (PHB 176).</li>
<li>Armor you are wearing only weighs half as much as the listed value.</li>
<li>There is no limit to the number of items you may attune.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feats">Feats</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lucky is not allowed.</li>
<li>All characters may have one feat chosen from the following list: Actor, Athlete, Magic Initiate, Prodigy, Skilled, or the <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UA-SkillFeats.pdf">Skill Feats</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="short-rest">Short Rest</h3>
<p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 10 minutes long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you take a short rest, you may expend a Hit Die to remove a level of exhaustion.</li>
<li>When you take a short rest, you may expend Hit Dice to regain expended spell levels (thus, spend 3 hit dice to regain a 3rd-level spell slot).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="long-rest">Long Rest</h3>
<p>When you complete a long rest, you gain a number of spent hit dice up to 1 + your Proficiency modifier. You cannot have more hit dice than you have levels.  You do not regain any hit points, per the Slow Natural Healing rules (DMG pg. 267); instead, you should spend hit dice before (or after) you complete your long rest to regain hit points.</p>
<h3 id="travel-and-rest">Travel and Rest</h3>
<p>Whenever you spend 8 or more hours traveling in a single day, a short rest takes 8 hours, instead of 10 minutes. To complete a long rest, you must spend at least 24 hours without traveling, at which point your short rests no longer take 8 hours.</p>
<h3 id="spells-and-spellcasting">Spells and Spellcasting</h3>
<ul>
<li>When taking damage, a character must roll a separate concentration check for each spell they are concentrating on.</li>
<li>If you are concentrating on more than one spell, you have disadvantage on concentration checks.</li>
<li>A restrained character cannot complete the somatic component of spells.</li>
<li>You may expend a hit die to concentrate on a second spell.</li>
<li>A wizard can prepare spells from any spellbook currently in their possession.</li>
<li>Any spell with a casting time between 1 and 30 minutes can now be cast with a casting time of 1 minute.</li>
</ul>
