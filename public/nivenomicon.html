<div class=column-break></div><h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Honestly, I didn't mean to compile a whole book of content.  We just kept making more, and one day I realised I was finding it hard to sort through everything in my binder, because it was so disorganized.  I tried to organize it, but the tools at hand just weren't good enough, and frankly it was tedious, so here we are.   The contents in this book represent a labor of love; a collection of dozens of brilliant ideas all made by us with the goal of good, silly fun.  Thank you all for your help.  I can't wait to see what we make next.</p>

Resting by the trunk of an old tree, the old forest offers many secrets. Not seen by many observers by day, but if one searches carefully they can find this travelling band of a thief and his foxes.  This pastoral masterpiece was drawn Joelin Tan as a part of his Kingdom Canidae project.

<div class="disclaimer wide">
Disclaimer: The Society of Silliness may take this game entirely too seriously.  Newcomers are warned not to invest too heavily into this hobby, as it will suck out your soul and use it as fuel for future creations. On the other hand, seeing your own ideas get published is pretty cool, so maybe the lack of a soul is worth it.

<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&amp;D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.</p>
<div class=descriptive>
<p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM):</strong> After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip (playing Gareth):</strong> I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues.</p>
<p><strong>Amy (playing Riva):</strong> The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p>
</div>
<p>Unlike a game of make-believe, D&amp;D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliﬀ, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull oﬀ some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p>
<div class=descriptive>
<p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM):</strong> OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re looking at the gargoyles?</p>
<p><strong>Phillip:</strong> Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?</p>
<p><strong>DM:</strong> Make an Intelligence check.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip:</strong> Does my Investigation skill apply?</p>
<p><strong>DM:</strong> Sure!</p>
<p><strong>Phillip (rolling a d20):</strong> Ugh. Seven.</p>
<p><strong>DM:</strong> They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?</p>
</div>
<p>In the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-flled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.</p>
<p>One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do.</p>
<p>Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&amp;D is infnitely ﬂexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.</p>
<p>The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a <strong>campaign</strong>. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reﬂected by an adventurer’s level. There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a
memorable story, they all win.</p>
<h2 id="worlds-of-adventure">Worlds of Adventure</h2>
<p>The many worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.</p>
<p>The worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Infnite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of them have been published as ofcial settings for the D&amp;D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&amp;D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.</p>
<div class=footnote>Introduction</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p6><p>All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in diﬀerent worlds. The halﬂings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fght in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&amp;D worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.</p>
<p>Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&amp;D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will aﬀect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the
setting is a published world.</p>
<h2 id="using-these-rules">Using These Rules</h2>
<p>The Nivenomicon has four main parts.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong> details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong> is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&amp;D, the rules for spellcasting, and a selection of typical spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p>
<p>The end of the document contains supplemental material. <strong>Appendix A</strong> collects all the definitions of conditions that can affect characters and monsters.  <strong>Appendix B</strong> is a collection of all of the changes made between the Nivenomicon and the D&amp;D Basic Rules. <strong>Appendix C</strong> is a changelog of every change that has happened in the Nivenomicon since its initial publication.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>The play of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>
<p><strong>1. The DM describes the environment.</strong> The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).</p>
<div class=column-break></div><p><strong>2. The players describe what they want to do.</strong> Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, diﬀerent adventurers do diﬀerent things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.</p>
<p>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the ﬂoor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p>
<p><strong>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.</strong> Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the ﬂow of the game right back to step 1.</p>
<p>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns  hoosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is ﬂuid and ﬂexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p>
<p>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound eﬀects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt diﬀerent voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature fgures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>
<h3 id="game-dice">Game Dice</h3>
<p>The game uses digital dice with different numbers of sides.  These dice are provided by <a href="https://www.roll20.net">Roll20</a>—an online service which provides maps, character sheets, initiative tracking, and dice rolling.</p>
<p>In these rules, the difference dice are referred to by the letter d followed by a number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20.  For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p>
<p>When you need to roll dice, your sheet should usually already be aware of how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, if you wish to roll your Acrobatics, you simply click on &quot;Acrobatics&quot; on your sheet, and Roll20 will roll &quot;1d20&quot; plus your Acrobatics score for you, which means it rolls one twenty-sided die and adds it to your Acrobatics score, then tells you the result.</p>
<p>If the DM asks you to roll a dice that aren't represented on your sheet, you can type the following into the Roll20 chat, and it will roll the appropriate dice for you.</p>
<center>`/roll [number]d[sides]±[modifier]`</center>
<div class=footnote>Introduction</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p7><h3 id="the-d20">The D20</h3>
<p>Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce oﬀ its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluﬀ? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a freball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>
<p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defned by six <strong>ability scores</strong>. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the <strong>ability modifers</strong> derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.</p>
<p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>
<p><strong>1. Roll the die and add a modifer.</strong> Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifer. This is typically the modifer derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a profciency bonus to reﬂect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifer.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</strong> A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other eﬀect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>
<p><strong>3. Compare the total to a target number.</strong> If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p>
<p>The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <strong>Difficulty Class</strong> (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an <strong>Armor Class</strong> (AC).</p>
<p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>
<h3 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
<p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modifed by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reﬂects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reﬂects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
<p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><h3 id="specific-beats-general">Specific Beats General</h3>
<p>This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specifc rule contradicts a general rule, the specifc rule wins.</p>
<p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don’t have profciency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>
<h3 id="round-down">Round Down</h3>
<p>There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p>
<h2 id="adventures">Adventures</h2>
<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is diﬀerent, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.</p>
<p>The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased oﬀ the shelf, tweaked and modifed to suit the DM’s needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.</p>
<p>Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, fnd something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try to do next.</p>
<p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges,</p>
<div class=footnote>Introduction</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p8><p>and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.</p>
<p>But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-pillars-of-adventure">The Three Pillars of Adventure</h3>
<p>Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration</strong> includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Social interaction</strong> features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.</p>
<p>The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong>, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&amp;D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfng down a ﬂight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.</p>
<h3 id="the-wonders-of-magic">The Wonders of Magic</h3>
<p>Few D&amp;D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10 and 11.</p>
<p>In the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.</p>
<p>For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnifed tenfold.</p>
<p>Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!</p>

They supplement the options in the <em>Player's Handbook</em> and are mroe rare in the worlds of D&amp;D than the races in that book are.</p>
<p>The following races are detailed in this chapter:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Tibbits</strong> are the descendants of the most common wizards' familiars: cats, able to take the form of small humans.</p>
<p>This chapter also contains new subraces for some existing races: <strong>Lythari Elf</strong>.</p>
<p>At the end of the chapter is a section you can use to determine the height and weight of a character who is a member of any one of the races in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="elf">Elf</h2>
<p>Most elves belong to the three most common subraces: high elves, wood elves, and drow. The Lythari are a new option for an elf's subrace, in addition to those found in the <em>Player's Handbook</em>.</p>
<h3 id="lythari">Lythari</h3>
<p>The reclusive lythari (originally Ly-tel-quessir), known among the wood elves as silver shadows, are true lycanthropes: good-aligned elves capable of changing into lupine form.</p>
<h4 id="lythari-subrace-traits">Lythari Subrace Traits</h4>
<p>The lythari subrace has the elf traits in the <em>Player's Handbook</em>, plus the subrace traits below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Damage Reduction.</strong></em> Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered is reduced by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Shapechanger.</strong></em> You can use your action to polymorph into a wolf. You can revert to your true form, that of an elf, by using a bonus action on your turn. Your statistics, other than listed below, are the same in each form. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for a wolf to wear a piece of equipment, based on its shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the new form has no effect until you leave the form. You revert to your true form if you die.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><p></p>
<p><em>Bite Attack.</em> While in wolf form, your bite is a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage for a normal unarmed strike. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can only knock a creature prone with your bite attack once per turn.</p>
<p><em>Fast Movement.</em> While in wolf form, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
<p><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em> While in wolf form, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
<p><em>Natural Armor.</em> While in wolf form, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.</p>
<p><em><strong>Wolf Tongue.</strong></em> Wolves and dogs can understand your speech, and you have the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most wolves and dogs lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you friendship with wolves or dogs, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</p>

<h2 id="tibbit">Tibbit</h2>
<p>Tibbits (also known as catweres) are small, humanoid creatures that have the ability to turn into a common house cat. They arose from felines kept as familiars in ages past. The powerful magic that allows a familiar to gain intelligence and magic abilities slowly filtered from one generation of cats to the next. Whether tibbits evolved from a natural process, divine intervention, or a sudden surge in the magic running through their ancestry, none can say. Tibbits have never existed in large numbers, and their tendency to spread across the world leaves them with a fractured, incomplete racial history.</p>
<p>Much like their feline ancestor, catfolk exhibit independence, curiosity, and quickness of mind and body. They rarely form communities larger than two or three families, and even these small colonies rarely hold together for more than a few years. Shortly after reaching adulthood, a tibbit develops an intense desire to wander the world and satisfy her racial curiosity. Tibbits can be found wherever humans and other civilized humanoid races have established cities, towns, and colonies.</p>
<p>Among humans and other humanoids tibbits usually remain in their cat form. The stray cat that prowls a neighborhood, the mangy cat adopted as a temple's unofficial pet, and the lazy feline always close at hand at the local tavern might be tibbits. Driven by curiosity, tibbits love to remain in their animal form while observing humans.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><p>Cynical observers contend that a tibbit seeks to spy on others. Tibbits hold that they merely like to keep an ear and eye out for any interesting bits of news. Tibbits are typically too chaotic, carefree, and impulsive to work as spies or hired killers. Upon overhearing a group of adventurers talking over a treasure map in hushed tones, a tibbit might be just as likely to shift into humanoid form on the spot and offer to join the adventure as she is to lose interest and chase down a juicy mouse she spotted across the tavern.</p>
<h3 id="the-lap-of-luxury">The Lap of Luxury</h3>
<p>Tibbits, as befits their heritage, are moody, curious, and sometimes arrogant. Many tibbits prefer the comforts of a fine meal (whether a succulent rodent or a five-course feast in the lap of luxury), stiff drink, and a soft couch. Even the most decadent tibbit, however, eventually succumbs to the steady pull of its curiosity. A tibbit might spend years living off the treasures it won in adventure, only to suddenly strike out into the unknown once again.</p>
<p>When dealing with others, tibbits show a similar capability to change their attitudes and posture depending on their moods. A tibbit might act relaxed and languid one moment, alert and inquisitive the next. They tend to have a slightly distant, arrogant attitude toward others, as if as a race they share a colossal, secret joke over other intelligent creatures. Still, once a tibbit marks someone as a friend few other creatures match their devotion. A tibbit might complain about a friend's needs or tend toward laziness, but when trouble arises she is a dauntless ally.</p>
<h3 id="feline-features">Feline Features</h3>
<p>In humanoid form, tibbits are small, stealthy, dark-skinned people with pointed ears and catlike eyes. Their hair tends to grow thick and long and males tend to grow sideburns. Their skin tones range from a tawny brown to black, but occasionally a tibbit has pure white skin. Their hair color matches the wide range of colors found in house cats, from pure white to striped silver to deep black.</p>
<p>In their cat form, tibbits look like fat but energetic house cats. They appear identical to—and indistinguishable from—any common, domesticated breed.</p>
<h3 id="curiouser-and-curiouser">Curiouser and Curiouser</h3>
<p>Tibbits tend to regard other folk with a detached sense of bemusement. Much of their lore and common wisdom regarding men, dwarves, and elves filters through their guise as house cats. Thus, tibbits see how other races act when they think no one else is around. To a tibbit, every intelligent creature is a bundle of secrets just waiting to unfurl before them.</p>
<div class=footnote>Part 1 | Races</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p12><p></p>
<p>In general, tibbits find humanity's ambition, drive, and fiery passion intriguing. They consider dwarves overly dour. Elves strike them as kindred spirits, as tibbits appreciate that the long-lived races share a similar tendency to see issues from different perspectives. They adore gnomes and halflings and many good-aligned tibbits adopt such folk. More than one kobold or goblin party has descended upon a sleepy gnome village or halfling caravan only to find an enraged tibbit wizard waiting for them. Gnome and halfling folk who have benefited from such welcome surprises have strong traditions of taking care of stray cats and treating their feline pets as treasured companions.</p>
<h3 id="natural-explorers">Natural Explorers</h3>
<p>Tibbits have no lands of their own. Instead, they dwell within civilized territories established by other folk. Any civilization that keeps domesticated cats likely houses colonies of tibbits within its cities.</p>
<p>Few tibbits make their identity openly known once they settle in an area. A tibbit is much more likely to remain in cat form as she travels through a city, although she usually keeps a well-hidden, luxurious apartment hidden in an out-of-the-way corner of town. Many tibbits become petty thieves, raiding pantries for fine foods, liquor, and other creature comforts.</p>
<p>Tibbits who travel the land might keep their humanoid guise to make dealings with other creatures easier. Even these tibbits prefer to pass themselves off as travelers from other planes, and they rarely publicize their ability to change shape.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><h3 id="tibbit-names">Tibbit Names</h3>
<p>Tibbits tend to adopt names based on their physical traits and deeds. A tibbit kitten is given a nickname by her parents or her master, one that reflects her temperament and appearance. When a tibbit comes of age she adopts a name of her choice. Tibbits tend to pick names from other folk, usually based solely on the sound.</p>
<p>Strangers and business partners use the name a tibbit picks for herself, while the tibbit's close friends and family use the original nickname chosen by her parents. A tibbit allows only her closest friends to learn and use her nickname. A nontibbit given such a privilege has received one of the highest honors a tibbit can grant to an outsider.</p>
<p>As a tibbit travels the world, she adopts a surname that reflects her experiences and important deeds. A tibbit usually changes her surname after such an event, but her true name uses all of her adopted surnames from childhood onward, and not just her latest one. When two tibbits meet, they share these long-form names to express their pasts with one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In general, tibbit names work for either sex. Whether male or female, a tibbit who has a short tail in cat form likely ends up with the nickname &quot;Spiketail.&quot;</p>
<p><em><strong>Parent-Bestowed Names:</strong></em> Blackpaw, Glittereye, Longear, Patchfur, Quickfang, Tumblepaw.</p>
<h3 id="adventurous">Adventurous</h3>
<p>The life of an adventurer comes naturally to a tibbit, as her curiosity pushes her ever onward. While many tibbits satisfy this drive with travel to civilized areas and exploration of a city's corners, some tibbits want more out of life. &quot;Adventurer&quot; is seen as a respected occupation among tibbits, and they have a natural fascination for adventurers of other races. In some cases, a tibbit in cat form takes to following an adventuring band, concealing its true nature until an opportune moment. A tibbit fighter might spring from cat to humanoid form in time to drive off a group of orcs that threatens the party's camp. In this manner, tibbits prove their valor and demonstrate their unmatched stealth in hopes of winning a place with their unwitting comrades.</p>

</section><section class=page id=p13><h3 id="tibbit-traits">Tibbit Traits</h3>
<p>Your tibbit character has a number of traits in common with all other tibbits.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> A tibbit reaches adulthood at the age of 16, and generally lives into the middle of his second or third century.</p>
<p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Tibbits have a strong tendency toward chaos and an equally strong lethargy toward moral issues, making the majority of them chaotic neutral. Carefree, decadent, and given to long periods of wallowing in luxury, tibbits can be maddeningly self-centered. Some tibbits tend toward proactive freedom-seeking, marking chaotic good as their second most common alignment. Such tibbits share many of their neutral brethren's tendencies, but a righteous struggle or a chance to spring a trap on evildoers rouses them to action.</p>
<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Tibbits average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is small.</p>
<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Escape Artist.</strong></em> Tibbits have advantage on checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple or the restrained condition.</p>
<p><em><strong>Feline Transformation.</strong></em> You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a house cat. You can remain in this form indefinitely, and only revert to your natural form when you are rendered unconscious. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of a cat, but you retain your hit points, alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies.</li>
<li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to those actions which a cat may take. Transforming does not break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</li>
<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if a cat is physically capable of doing so.</li>
<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for a cat to wear a piece of equipment, based on its shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the new form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Keen Senses.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in Perception.</p>
<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and you can speak and understand Feline. The Feline language, a strange combination of purrs, hisses, and empathic transfers, allows tibbits to communicate with cats of all forms. Tibbits are born with the knowledge of this language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Naturally Stealthy.</strong></em> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><p><em><strong>Subrace.</strong></em> The two main kinds of tibbits, alley cats and domestics, refer more to whether the tibbit was raised in a Wizard's tower, or on the streets.</p>
<h4 id="alley-cat">Alley Cat</h4>
<p>As an Alley Cat, you have lived your life largely as one of exploration and curiosity, unfettered by any master or calling. You're inclined to boldness, independence, and perhaps a bit of overconfidence.</p>
<p>Alley Cats are more prone to wander than other tibbits, rarely settling in one place for long as they constantly seek a better patch of sunlight to rest in.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Free Spirit.</strong></em> You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>
<p><em><strong>Scavenger:</strong></em> Starvation is no stranger; you require food half as often as a normal character.</p>
<h4 id="domestic">Domestic</h4>
<p>As a domestic, you were raised in the care of a wizard. You learned to respect his studious nature, and were well cared for during most of the days. Your master's constant thirst for knowledge only fueled your own curiosity, granting you insight into secrets other tibbits wish they understood, and your constant exposure to magic gave you an inherent resistance to it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Arcane Infusion.</strong></em> You know the <em>prestidigitation</em> cantrip.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Art of Laziness.</strong></em> You are used to taking short naps throughout the day whenever you can get the opportunity. You are able to complete a short rest in half the time, and after resting for at least 4 hours throughout the course of a day, you can gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. You may still only benefit from one long rest in any twenty-four hour period.</p>

<h2 class=notoc>Martial Archetypes</h2>
<h3 id="cerebral-commander">Cerebral Commander</h3>
<p>Where the mystic focuses on studying psionics and unlocking the mysteries of the mind, the cerebral commander simply uses his mental prowess to spur others into battle.  A cerebral commander blends psionics and martial prowess together harmoniously, becoming a fierce and effective leader.</p>
<h4 id="psionics">Psionics</h4>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to use psionic powers.  See the Psionic Disciplines section of the <em>Psionics Handbook</em> for the general rules of using powers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Talents.</strong></em> You learn one talent of your choice.  You learn an additional talent of your choice at 7th and 10th level.</p>
<p><em><strong>Psi Points.</strong></em> The Cerebral Commander Psionics table shows how many psi points you have to use your discipline effects.  The table also shows your psi limit. You regain all expended psi points when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disciplines Known.</strong></em> You know the Mantle of Command discipline.</p>
<p>The Disciplines Known column of the Cerebral Commander Psionics table sh ows when you learn more disciplines.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Psionics Ability.</strong></em> Wisdom is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You can use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline, or when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<center>
<p><strong>Discipline save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your <br />Wisdom modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + <br />your Wisdom modifier.</p>
</center>
<h4 id="commander's-pride">Commander's Pride</h4>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, whenever an ally you can see within 30 feet of you other than you reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you immediately regain 2 psi points.  You can only benefit from this feature once per turn.</p>
<h4 id="ardent-commander">Ardent Commander</h4>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend 2 pp. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack.</p>
<h4 id="rallying-surge">Rallying Surge</h4>
<p>At 10th level, when you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to five creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal to your fighter level, provided that creature can see or hear you.</p>

<p>It is said that those who follow the ways of the beast eaters have forsaken the very essence of mortality in exchange for untold power. A beast eater absorbs the power of the monsters they have slain, but many would argue they have sacrificed their own soul to do so. A beast eater bites with the sharpness of the wolf, strikes with the swiftness of the adder, and lashes out with the stinger of the scorpion, fueling strange and powerful magics with their ki.</p>
<p>A beast eater may spend as much time among the beasts he consumes as he does in civilization, and is equally adept at navigating either field, allowing him to go unnoticed until he summons forth the dread powers at his command.</p>
<h4 id="beast-lore">Beast Lore</h4>
<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn rituals which allow you to cast spells or monster abilities. Beast eaters refer to both spells and monster abilities as lore, and you must go out of your way to learn new lore during your adventures.</p>
<p><em><strong>Basic Lore.</strong></em> You learn 3 cantrips selected from the Sorcerer spell list. You learn another cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
<p>In place of cantrips, you can learn &quot;basic monster abilities&quot;, which are weapon attacks taken from any beast with a CR less than 1. When you take the Attack Action on your turn, you may choose to use a basic monster ability instead of your weapon or unarmed attack, using your Wisdom modifier for the attack and damage roll. Basic monster abilities do not expend any ki or spell slots.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lore Costs.</strong></em> To cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of ki equal to the Spell's level. To use a monster ability, you must expend a number of ki equal to the monster's CR.</p>
<p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a beast lore spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. The maximum number of ki points (its base ki point cost plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell is 2. This maximum increases to 3 at 7th level, 4 at 13th level, and 5 at 17th level. You are never limited in the number of ki you can spend to activate a monster ability.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="basic-monster-abilities">Basic Monster Abilities</h5>
<p>In most cases, basic monster abilities are interesting and flavorful, such as an Ape's &quot;rock&quot;, or a Crocodile's &quot;bite&quot;. DMs are advised against allowing the use of the Giant Wasp's sting in their games as it deals more damage than intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class=column-break></div><p></p>
<p><em><strong>Gaining Lore.</strong></em> As you encounter new experiences, you are granted access to lore. In order to learn a new spell or monster ability, you must first experience the effects of that spell or monster ability by being targeted by it, or by being in the spell or ability's area of effect. During a short or long rest, you may learn a new lore that you have experienced in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Lore Known column of the Beast Eater Lore table shows how many spells or monster abilities you can learn. The Maximum Spell Lore column determines the maximum level of spell you may learn, and the Maximum Monster Lore column determines the maximum CR of a creature from which you can gain lore.</p>
<p>If you have already learned your maximum amount of lore, you can choose to forget a lore you know in order to replace it with a new lore. If you experience a cantrip, or a weapon attack from a beast whose CR is less than 1, you may choose to replace one of your basic lore with these abilities.</p>
<p><em><strong>Casting Lore.</strong></em> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your lore spells, since its power is drawn from your ki. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a lore spell or ability you cast, and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<center>
<p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br />your Wisdom modifier</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + <br />your Wisdom modifier</p>
</center>
<h4 id="monster-affinity">Monster Affinity</h4>
<p>Also at 3rd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. If you lack proficiency in the required skill, you are treated as having it only for the purposes of these monster knowledge checks, but your proficiency bonus is not doubled.</p>
<h4 id="infusion">Infusion</h4>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to consume the monsters you fight to gain even more of their power. You can attempt to learn a monster's passive abilities (movement, natural armor, damage resistances, senses, save or skill proficiencies, languages, and special traits) in a manner similar to how you gain Lore.</p>
<p>To gain an infusion, you must first experience that ability by attempting to consume a part of the monster who possesses it. You must eat enough of the monster to constitute a meal as a part of a short rest. Once you have done so, you learn one of the monster's passive abilities as an infusion.</p>
<p>The Infusions Known column of the Beast Eater Lore table determines how many infusions you may know. You are still limited to creatures whose CR does not exceed your Maximum Monster Lore.</p>
<p>A beast eater's form often changes to reflect the abilities learned. If you gain the natural base armor 14 of the Galeb Duhr, then your skin might take on a rocky appearance.</p>

<div class=column-break></div><h4 id="consumption">Consumption</h4>
<p>By 11th level, through your study of spells and monsters, you gain the ability to consume the magic thrown against you, and turn it back on its creator. If you are targeted by a spell, or in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to make a Wisdom check against a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell fails and has no effect.</p>
<p>Until the end of your next turn, you know the spell that you have consumed and can cast it with your own ki, even if the spell requires more ki to cast than you are normally allowed to spend on a spell at your level.</p>
<p>Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="assimilation">Assimilation</h4>
<p>At 17th level, you have learned to absorb not only a monster's powers, but the monster itself. As an action, you can touch a creature and attempt to absorb it. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your lore save DC. On a failed saving throw, the target is banished to a demiplane associated with your existence, and you are transformed into that creature.</p>
<p>The target remains there for up to ten minutes, or until it escapes or you fall unconscious. The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes and the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the nearest unoccupied space next to you.</p>
<p>While transformed into the target, you gain the target's appearance and all of its equipment, and your statistics and ability scores become those of the target, except for your Hit Points, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores. You may use any of the creature's abilities or powers as if you were that creature.</p>
<p>Once you have used this ability, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>

<h2 class=notoc>Rogueish Archetypes</h2>
At 3rd level, a rogue gains the Roguish Archetype feature. The following options are available to a rogue, in addition to those offered in the _Player's Handbook_: the Sensate.
<h3 id="sensate">Sensate</h3>
<p>The breeze that caresses the face brings with it a cooling balm and scent traces that trigger memories of old. The flavor of the fruit plucked from the tree is tart but sweet, and the sticky juice explodes in the mouth with a texture just as important as taste. The voices of the choir are rough but earnest, and they speak of experiences hidden in the melody that only a sensate can separate from the mix and appreciate.</p>
<h4 id="heightened-senses">Heightened Senses</h4>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, your sense of smell, hearing, and touch intensify. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks which rely on your sense of smell, hearing or touch, and can track by your sense of smell.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<h4 id="joie-de-vivre">Joie de Vivre</h4>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your cheerful optimism and willing curiosity inspires hope in your allies. As a reaction, you may grant a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to an ally when they make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.</p>
<h4 id="sense-link">Sense Link</h4>
<p>Starting at 9th level, you are able to share your senses with another creature, and experience their senses as if they were your own. As an action on your turn, you may touch a creature to link with them. As an action, you or the creature you are linked with can experience through one another's senses (see through the other's eyes, hear what the other hears, etc.) until the start of your next turn.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><p></p>
<p>As long as you remain on the same plane with the creature, this link will not break or end. You may only be linked with one creature at a time. If you link with a new creature, the link with the first will end immediately.</p>
<h4 id="seen-it-before">Seen it Before</h4>
<p>Also at 9th level, you become skeptical to things that are out of place. You have Advantage on any saving throws or ability checks made to identify or see through an illusion.</p>
<h4 id="intensify-sensation">Intensify Sensation</h4>
<p>By 13th level, you have a keen understanding of the sensations of those around you, as well as your own. As a bonus action, choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice) for the next minute:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerability to slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage.</li>
<li>Disadvantage on Saving Throws.</li>
<li>Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="see-it-again">See it Again</h4>
<p>When you reach 17th level, you are able to recast a spell from another spellcaster. Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to cast that spell, yourself. When you cast the spell, you may choose the target or area affected as normal. Your Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. The spell is cast at the same level as it was cast against you.</p>
<p>Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you have finished a long rest.</p>

<h2 class=notoc>Arcane Traditions</h2>
At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition feature. The following options are available to a wizard, in addition to the options offered in the _Player's Handbook_: School of Theology.
<h3 id="theology">Theology</h3>
<p>Students of the school of Theology are wizards who have turned their study to the divine. These scholars seek out and collect esoteric sources of divine lore, wherever those sources might be. Theologians are not always tied to a specific deity, but they do acknowledge that some of their power may be divinely fueled, as they draw upon the rituals and prayers used by the faithful.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-proficiencies">Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
<p>When you study the tradition of theology at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Religion skill. If you are already trained in Religion, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency.</p>
<h4 id="theology-savant">Theology Savant</h4>
<p>Your study of divine magic allows you to learn spells from the cleric class.</p>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, each level when your Spellcasting feature lets you add two new spells to your spellbook, you can choose to add one new spell from the cleric spell list or the wizard spell list. Your other spell must still be from the wizard spell list, and you must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell. This spell becomes a wizard spell for you.</p>
<p>In addition, when you find a cleric spell scroll or text of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level you can prepare, and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a cleric spell into your spellbook follows the same rules as those required for a wizard spell, and any spell you copy into your spellbook in this way becomes a wizard spell for you.</p>
<p>You can prepare any cleric spells added to your spellbook via this feature as you would any other wizard spell.</p>
<h4 id="arcane-censure">Arcane Censure</h4>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to impose your arcane censure upon them. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the triggering attack has disadvantage, and attack rolls against them have advantage until the end of the creature's next turn. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have completed a short or long rest.</p>
<h4 id="magical-secrets">Magical Secrets</h4>
<p>At 10th level, you learn may add two spells of your choice from any class to your spellbook. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Wizard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as wizard spells for you.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><h4 id="divine-utterance">Divine Utterance</h4>
<p>At 14th level, you have learned secrets which were not meant to be learned without the protection of a divine agent. As a bonus action on your turn, you can utter these divine secrets to a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see and which can hear you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded, deafened, and incapacitated for 1 minute. At the end of its turn, the creature can reattempt the saving throw.</p>
<p>Once you have used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>

If a feature is enhanced, you continue to enjoy its benefits but now with new capabilities.</p>

<p>Every time you make a melee attack, whether the attack hits or misses, you can choose to mark your target. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn. While a target is marked by you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a target. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.</p>
<p>The first time a creature you have marked that is within reach of your weapon moves or makes an attack that does not include you, you can make an opportunity attack against that creature without expending your reaction.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><h4 id="roll-with-it">Roll with It</h4>
<p><em>1st-level Fighter Feature (replaces Second Wind)</em></p>
<p>You have learned to roll with the punches and shake off the worst damage. As a reaction whenever you take damage, you can reduce the damage taken by a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
<h3 id="monk-2">Monk</h3>

<h4 id="forceful-defense">Forceful Defense</h4>
<p><em>1st-level Monk feature (replaces Unarmored Defense)</em></p>

<h3 id="paladin">Paladin</h3>
<p>A paladin has access to the following features.</p>
<h4 id="divine-sanction">Divine Sanction</h4>
<p><em>2nd-level Paladin feature (replaces Divine Smite)</em></p>
<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you mark one target you can see that is within 30 feet of you. While a target is marked by you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a target. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.</p>
<p>When a creature you have marked makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target. This damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>
<p>The mark expires if you use this ability to mark a different creature. The mark also ends if you make an attack against a creature other than the target of the mark, unless you have also attacked your target during this turn, or are adjacent to the target.</p>
<h3 id="ranger">Ranger</h3>
<p>A ranger has access to the following features</p>
<h4 id="prepared-spellcasting">Prepared Spellcasting</h4>
<p><em>2nd-level Ranger feature (enhances spellcasting)</em></p>

<h4 id="binder">Binder</h4>
<p><em>1st-level Warlock feature (enhances all features)</em></p>
<p>Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence, and all class features which refer to Charisma instead refer to Intelligence. You are proficient in Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws.</p>
<h4 id="pact-of-the-blade">Pact of the Blade</h4>
<p><em>3rd-level Warlock feature (enhances Pact of the Blade)</em></p>
<p>If the weapon you have created with your Pact of the Blade lacks the two-handed property, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for its attack and damage rolls.</p>
<p>Starting at 5th level, you can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<h3 id="wizard-2">Wizard</h3>
<p>A wizard has access to the following features.</p>
<h4 id="cantrip-versatility">Cantrip Versatility</h4>
<p><em>1st-level Wizard feature (enhances Cantrips)</em></p>
<p>You record your cantrips in your spellbook just like any other spell.  You begin play by adding 4 cantrips to your spellbook from the Wizard spell list.  You must prepare your cantrips in order to cast them, just as your other spells; however, these do not count against your usual spell preparation limit. Instead, you may prepare a number of cantrips equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>Adding a new cantrip to your spellbook takes 8 hours, and costs 25 gp.  The cost represents the material components you expend as you experiment with the cantrip to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.  Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the cantrip just like your other cantrips.</p>

<h2 id="masterwork-items">Masterwork Items</h2>
<p>Anyone with sufficient training, time, and resources can craft weapons, armor, and tools.  However, many craftsmen spend years of their life practicing their trade in the hopes of crafting perfection.  Sometimes, they achieve greatness, and create an item of surpassing quality.</p>
<p>Masterwork weapons, armor, and tools provide a bonus based on their rarity.  Masterwork implements provide bonuses based on their type (attack and damage rolls for weapons, AC for armor, and relevant ability checks for tools).</p>
<p>An uncommon (+1) masterwork item is typically the greatest a smith will achieve in their lifetime.  These are nearly perfect in every way: light, strong, well-balanced, durable.  They are truly impressive, but not the stuff of legends.</p>
<p>A rare (+2) masterwork item surpasses the work of even talented smiths. Items of this quality may take years to forge, and most have storied pasts.  These are the pinnacle of what a mortal smith can achieve without magical assistance.</p>
<p>Very rare (+3) masterwork items are the stuff of legends.  They are perfect in every way; flawless works of art that surely must have required a bit of magic just to forge.</p>
<p>The value of a masterwork item is based on its rarity.  To determine the value of a masterwork item, add the base item cost to the appropriate value from the Mastework Items table, below.</p>

<p>Masterwork weapons are not magical, and do not bypass magical resistances.  Magical weapons, in turn, are frequently also masterwork, but always contain at least some magical properties which allows them to bypass resistance.</p>
<p>Magical items are frequently also masterwork, although it isn't required, but a magical item which provides only a statistical bonus is never magical.  For example, a masterwork longsword is just masterwork, but a <em>masterwork glowing longsword</em> is both masterwork and a common magical item.  When pricing such items, add the price of masterwork to the price of the item.  If it costs 100 gp to add the <em>glowing</em> property to a weapon to make it magical, then a <em>masterwork glowing longsword</em> should cost about 300 gp.</p>

<h4 id="animate-dead">Animate Dead</h4>
<p><em>3rd-level necromancy</em></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</li>
<li><strong>Range:</strong> 10 ft</li>
<li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)</li>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or the corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range.  Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).  This creature is proficient with any armor or weapons you provide them, but cannot activate magical items or use complex tools.</p>
<p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command a creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you.  You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.  If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
<p>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, or until you cast this spell again to animate a new creature, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it and becomes indifferent to you. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p>
<p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature gains multiattack and can make a number of attacks equal to one-third of the spell's level (rounded up).  Zombies created by this spell gain 10 extra hit points for each slot level above 3rd, as well as +1 to hit and damage for every two slot levels above 3rd.  Skeletons created with this spell gain 5 extra hit points for each slot level above 3rd, as well as +1 to hit and damage for every slot level above 3rd.</p>

<li><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</li>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>
</ul>
<p>You draw a line of electricity in the air, and it jumps to your target. Make a ranged spell attack.  If you hit, the target takes 1d6 electricity damage, and you can choose another target within 10 feet of the previous target.  If you choose another target, make another ranged spell attack, and if you hit, the target takes electricity damage one die size smaller than the previous target took.  You may continue in this way until you miss, or until the die size is 1d4.</p>
<p>The spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the initial damage is 1d8.  The damage increases again to 1d10 at 11th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.</p>

<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>
</ul>
<p>When you complete the ritual, the corpse dissolves into ashes.  Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
<p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

<li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</li>
<li><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</li>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</li>
</ul>
<p>You draw weakness out of a creature of your choice that you can see within range.  You can end either one disease or one condition on the target. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</p>
<p>You receive whichever affliction (disease or condition) cured from the target for the duration of this spell. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw against your own spell DC. On a success, the affliction ends early.</p>

On a successful save, the original target instead takes half damage, and you are unable to heal another creature.</p>

<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>
</ul>
<p>You draw the athame along your palm while chanting the words of power that draw the magic from your blood.  You take 1d4 necrotic damage, and 3 other creatures of your choice within range gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage done.</p>
<p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

The area becomes lightly obscured for the duration, and creatures within the area have their speed reduced by 10 feet.  When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 cold damage for every 5 feet it travels as the spectral creatures grasp at them.</p>
<h4 id="glitterdust">Glitterdust</h4>
<p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p>
<hr />

While within 5 feet of a magical effect or object, you can discern the source of the magic and how long it has been in place. if the magical item or effect was created within the last year and on the same plane of existence as the caster, this spell reveals the creature type that created the effect or item.   If the source of the magical effect is not the result of deliberate action (such as a wild magical effect), this spell fails.  If the effect was created on another plane of existence, or is older than one year, the spell has no effect.</p>
<p>Additionally, the spell reveals the age of the magical effect in terms of one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate:</strong> The effect was created within the last 24 hours.</li>

</ul>
<p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell can look back as far as the creation of the plane the caster is on, and magical effects may be revealed with the following category:</p>

The phantasm disappears, and you can resummon it anywhere within range on your turn as a bonus action. If the you end your turn more than 30 feet from the phantasm, this spell ends.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><h4 id="pluck-the-heartstrings">Pluck the Heartstrings</h4>

<p>You glare at one creature you can see within range and the target must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed saving throw, you learn the answer to up to three questions.  The spell can only reveal objective facts about the target which have not been concealed or hidden.  If you ask a question which would lead to concealed or hidden information, you learn that the answer is concealed, but not the answer.  You can use each answer once to gain advantage on a social roll made against the target.</p>
