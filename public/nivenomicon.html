<div class=column-break></div><h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t mean to compile a whole book of content.  We just kept making more, and one day I realised I was finding it hard to sort through everything in my binder, because it was so disorganized.  I tried to organize it, but the tools at hand just weren’t good enough, and frankly it was tedious, so here we are.   The contents in this book represent a labor of love; a collection of dozens of brilliant ideas all made by us with the goal of good, silly fun.  Thank you all for your help.  I can’t wait to see what we make next.</p>

Resting by the trunk of an old tree, the old forest offers many secrets. Not seen by many observers by day, but if one searches carefully they can find this travelling band of a thief and his foxes.  This pastoral masterpiece was drawn Joelin Tan as a part of his Kingdom Canidae project.

</section><section class=page id=p6><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&amp;D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.</p>
<div class=descriptive>
<p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM):</strong> After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip (playing Gareth):</strong> I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues.</p>
<p><strong>Amy (playing Riva):</strong> The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p>
</div>
<p>Unlike a game of make-believe, D&amp;D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p>
<div class=descriptive>
<p><strong>Dungeon Master (DM):</strong> OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re looking at the gargoyles?</p>
<p><strong>Phillip:</strong> Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?</p>
<p><strong>DM:</strong> Make an Intelligence check.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip:</strong> Does my Investigation skill apply?</p>
<p><strong>DM:</strong> Sure!</p>
<p><strong>Phillip (rolling a d20):</strong> Ugh. Seven.</p>
<p><strong>DM:</strong> They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?</p>
</div>
<p>In the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.</p>
<p>One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do.</p>
<p>Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&amp;D is infnitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.</p>
<p>The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a <strong>campaign</strong>. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level. There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a
memorable story, they all win.</p>
<h2 id="worlds-of-adventure">Worlds of Adventure</h2>
<p>The many worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.</p>
<p>The worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Infnite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of them have been published as ofcial settings for the D&amp;D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&amp;D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.</p>
<div class=footnote>Introduction</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p7><p>All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fght in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&amp;D worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.</p>
<p>Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&amp;D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the
setting is a published world.</p>
<h2 id="using-these-rules">Using These Rules</h2>
<p>The Nivenomicon has four main parts.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong> details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong> is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&amp;D, the rules for spellcasting, and a selection of typical spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p>
<p>The end of the document contains supplemental material. <strong>Appendix A</strong> collects all the definitions of conditions that can affect characters and monsters.  <strong>Appendix B</strong> is a collection of all of the changes made between the Nivenomicon and the D&amp;D Basic Rules. <strong>Appendix C</strong> is a changelog of every change that has happened in the Nivenomicon since its initial publication.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>The play of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.</p>
<p><strong>1. The DM describes the environment.</strong> The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).</p>
<div class=column-break></div><p><strong>2. The players describe what they want to do.</strong> Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, “We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.</p>
<p>Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p>
<p><strong>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.</strong> Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</p>
<p>This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns  choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p>
<p>Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>
<h3 id="game-dice">Game Dice</h3>
<p>The game uses digital dice with different numbers of sides.  These dice are provided by <a href="https://www.roll20.net">Roll20</a>—an online service which provides maps, character sheets, initiative tracking, and dice rolling.</p>
<p>In these rules, the difference dice are referred to by the letter d followed by a number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20.  For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p>
<p>When you need to roll dice, your sheet should usually already be aware of how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, if you wish to roll your Acrobatics, you simply click on “Acrobatics” on your sheet, and Roll20 will roll “1d20” plus your Acrobatics score for you, which means it rolls one twenty-sided die and adds it to your Acrobatics score, then tells you the result.</p>
<p>If the DM asks you to roll a dice that aren’t represented on your sheet, you can type the following into the Roll20 chat, and it will roll the appropriate dice for you.</p>
<center>
<p><code>/roll [number]d[sides]±[modifier]</code></p>
</center>
<div class=footnote>Introduction</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p8><h3 id="the-d20">The D20</h3>
<p>Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a freball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>
<p>Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defned by six <strong>ability scores</strong>. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the <strong>ability modifers</strong> derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or monster’s behalf.</p>
<p>Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>
<p><strong>1. Roll the die and add a modifer.</strong> Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifer. This is typically the modifer derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a profciency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability’s modifer.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</strong> A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>
<p><strong>3. Compare the total to a target number.</strong> If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p>
<p>The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a <strong>Difficulty Class</strong> (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an <strong>Armor Class</strong> (AC).</p>
<p>This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>
<img src="https://catrpgs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sketchydice.png" style="margin: 0 auto; mix-blend-mode: darken; width: 75%;" />
<div class=column-break></div><h3 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
<p>Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modifed by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
<p>More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.</p>
<h3 id="specific-beats-general">Specific Beats General</h3>
<p>This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specifc rule contradicts a general rule, the specifc rule wins.</p>
<p>Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don’t have profciency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>
<h3 id="round-down">Round Down</h3>
<p>There’s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p>
<h2 id="adventures">Adventures</h2>
<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.</p>
<p>The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modifed to suit the DM’s needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.</p>
<div class=footnote>Introduction</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p9><p>Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, fnd something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try to do next.</p>
<p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges,</p>
<p>and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.</p>
<p>But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-pillars-of-adventure">The Three Pillars of Adventure</h3>
<p>Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration</strong> includes both the adventurers’ movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Social interaction</strong> features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.</p>
<p>The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong>, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&amp;D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfng down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.</p>
<h3 id="the-wonders-of-magic">The Wonders of Magic</h3>
<p>Few D&amp;D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10 and 11.</p>
<p>In the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.</p>
<p>For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnifed tenfold.</p>
<p>Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!</p>

<h1 id="chapter-1%3A-step-by-step-characters">Chapter 1<s>:</s> <span>Step-by-Step Characters</span></h1>
<p>Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world.</p>
<p>Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any Dungeons &amp; Dragons book to see what catches your interest.</p>
<p>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.</p>
<p>Throughout this section, we use the term <strong>character sheet</strong> to mean your character sheet in roll20.</p>
<h5 class=notoc>Building Bruenor</h5>
<p>Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf character, Bruenor.</p>
<h3 id="1.-choose-a-race">1. Choose a Race</h3>
<p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&amp;D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some</p>
<div class=column-break></div><p>races also have <strong>subraces</strong>, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2: Races provides more information about these races.</p>
<p>The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.</p>
<p>Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.</p>
<p>Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.</p>
<h5 id="building-bruenor%2C-step-1">Building Bruenor, Step 1</h5>
<p>Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.</p>
<h3 id="2.-choose-a-class">2. Choose a Class</h3>
<p>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in Chapter 3: Classes.</p>
<p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are <strong>class features</strong>—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of <strong>proficiencies</strong>: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>
<p>On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gezbRSW.png" class=full-page />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1FYuy1d.png" class=full-page />
<div class="image-placeholder"></div>
</section><section class=page id=p12><h4 id="level">Level</h4>
<p>Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining <strong>experience points</strong> (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.</p>
<p>Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&amp;D campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.</p>
<p>Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this section).</p>
<h4 id="hit-points-and-hit-dice">Hit Points and Hit Dice</h4>
<p>Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).</p>
<p>At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your <strong>hit point maximum</strong>.</p>
<p>Record your character’s hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in Chapter 8: Adventuring).</p>
<h4 id="proficiency-bonus">Proficiency Bonus</h4>
<p>The table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with</li>
<li>Attack rolls with spells you cast</li>
<li>Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in</li>
<li>Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with</li>
<li>Saving throws you’re proficient in</li>
<li>Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each spellcasting class)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in Chapter 7, tools in Chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.</p>
<p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.</p>
<h5 id="building-bruenor%2C-step-2">Building Bruenor, Step 2</h5>
<p>Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet.</p>
<p>As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10—and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.</p>
<h3 id="3.-determine-ability-scores">3. Determine Ability Scores</h3>
<p>Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: <strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Dexterity</strong>, <strong>Constitution</strong>, <strong>Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and <strong>Charisma</strong>. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>
<p>The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the Using Ability Scores section of Chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.</p>
<p>You generate your character’s six <strong>ability scores</strong> randomly.  Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper.  Subtract the number you have rolled from 23 and record this second number.  Repeat this process twice, subtracting the rolled result from 25 and 27, so that you have six numbers written down. If any number is greater than an 18, or less than a 7, reroll the pair that led to the out-of-bounds results.  Additionally, if none of your six numbers are 15 or higher, you may choose to reroll any pair until you get at least one number equal to 15 or higher.</p>
<p>Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.</p>
<p>After assigning your ability scores, determine your <strong>ability modifiers</strong> using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>
<h5 id="building-bruenor%2C-step-3">Building Bruenor, Step 3</h5>
<p>Bob rolls four 6-sided dice, and gets a 1, a 2, 2, and a 4.  Subtracting the 1, he records an 8 as his first score, and then subtracts 8 from 23 to get his second score of 15. He then rolls again and gets a 14 for his third score, and then subtracts 14 from 25 to get his fouth score of 11. Finally, he rolls a 13, then subtracts 13 from 27 to get his final score of 14.</p>
<p>He now has the following numbers written down: (8, 15, 14, 11, 13, 14). Since he’s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2),</p>
<div class=footnote>Part 1 | Step-by-Step Characters</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p13><p>Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 11 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 13 (+1).</p>
<p>Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.</p>

<h3 id="4.-describe-your-character">4. Describe Your Character</h3>
<p>Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.</p>
<p>Using the information in Chapter 4, you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s <strong>alignment</strong> (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and <strong>ideals</strong>. Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called <strong>bonds</strong>, and the <strong>flaws</strong> that could one day undermine him or her.</p>
<p>Your character’s <strong>background</strong> describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character’s place in the D&amp;D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in Chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.</p>
<p>A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.</p>
<h4 id="your-character%E2%80%99s-abilities">Your Character’s Abilities</h4>
<p>Take your character’s ability scores and race into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.</p>
<p>For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.</p>
<p>A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.</p>
<p>A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.</p>
<p>A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.</p>
<p>A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.</p>
<p>A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.</p>
<h5 id="building-bruenor%2C-step-4">Building Bruenor, Step 4</h5>
<p>Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but his clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.</p>
<p>Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law.</p>
<img src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/973/102.png" style="mix-blend-mode: darken; width: 100%; transform: scaleX(-1);" />
<div class=footnote>Part 1 | Step-by-Step Characters</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p14><p>Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted.</p>
<h3 id="5.-choose-equipment">5. Choose Equipment</h3>
<p>Your class and background determine your character’s <strong>starting equipment</strong>, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in Chapter 5.</p>
<p>Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of <strong>gold pieces</strong> (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in the Equipment section. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that section. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the “Trinkets” table at the end of the Equipment section).</p>
<p>Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.</p>
<h4 id="armor-class">Armor Class</h4>
<p>Your <strong>Armor Class</strong> (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.</p>
<p>Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in Chapter 5. Record your AC on your character sheet.</p>
<p>Your character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in Chapter 5.</p>
<p>Some spells and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.</p>
<h4 id="weapons">Weapons</h4>
<p>For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.</p>
<p>When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.</p>
<ul>
<li>For attacks with <strong>melee weapons</strong>, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.</li>
<li>For attacks with <strong>ranged weapons</strong>, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.</li>
</ul>
<div class=column-break></div><h5 id="building-bruenor%2C-step-5">Building Bruenor, Step 5</h5>
<p>Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.</p>
<p>For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when it hits.</p>
<h3 id="6.-come-together">6. Come Together</h3>
<p>Most D&amp;D characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a <strong>party</strong>, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-1st-level">Beyond 1st Level</h3>
<p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called <strong>gaining a level</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="class-features-and-hit-dice">Class Features and Hit Dice</h4>
<p>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum.  Alternatively, you can ask the DM to roll your Hit Dice (even if you have already rolled), but you must use the DM’s roll.</p>
<p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.</p>
<h4 id="xp-and-proficiency-bonus-progression">XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression</h4>
<p>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.</p>

<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p15><h4 id="tiers-of-play">Tiers of Play</h4>
<p>The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels.</p>
<p>In the <strong>novice tier</strong> (levels 1–4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages.</p>
<p>In the <strong>heroic tier</strong> (levels 5–10), characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as <em>fireball</em> and <em>lightning bolt</em>. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p>
<p>In the <strong>paragon tier</strong> (levels 11–16), characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole regions and continents.</p>
<p>At the <strong>epic tier</strong> (levels 17–20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-2%3A-races">Chapter 2<s>:</s> <span>Races</span></h1>
<p>A visit to one of the great cities in the world of Aesl—like Feldrun, Fallwater, or Cemenhuatl—overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.</p>
<p>And the people themselves—people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues—represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful half-elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.</p>
<p>Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord.  And there, slinking amongst the alleys, a lone tibbit watches all of the rest, curiosity warring with survival as the little cat decides whether to join in the merriment.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-race">Choosing a Race</h2>
<p>Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&amp;D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, half-elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.</p>
<p>Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, half-elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Dragonborn, gnomes, elves, half-orcs, and tieflings are less common as adventurers.</p>
<p>Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.</p>
<p>Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character’s story. Each race’s description in this section includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><h2 id="racial-traits">Racial Traits</h2>
<p>The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h3>
<p>Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in Chapter 5.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. “Personality and Background” lists the most common languages of the D&amp;D multiverse.</p>
<h3 id="subraces">Subraces</h3>
<p>Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and country to country.</p>

<h2 id="dwarf">Dwarf</h2>
<div class=racial-quote>
<p>“Yer late, elf!” came the rough edge of a familiar voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort, the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble if I came out an’ looked for ye!”</p>
<p>— R.A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard</p>
</div>
<p>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—these common threads unite all dwarves.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><div style="height: 350px;"></div>
<div style="float: left; height: 135px; width: 60px;">&nbsp;</div>
<h3 id="short-and-stout">Short and Stout</h3>
<p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.</p>
<p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>
<h3 id="long-memory%2C-long-grudges">Long Memory, Long Grudges</h3>
<p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>
<p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p>
<p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done</p>
<div class=footnote>Part 1 | Races</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p18><img src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/619/850/190/dwarfintro.png" class="top-full-image" style="left: auto; right: 0; width: 200%;" />
<div class=wide style="height: 300px;"></div>
<p>to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>
<h3 id="clans-and-kingdoms">Clans and Kingdoms</h3>
<p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>
<p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>
<p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>
<h3 id="gods%2C-gold%2C-and-clan">Gods, Gold, and Clan</h3>
<p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><blockquote>
<h5 id="slow-to-trust">Slow to Trust</h5>
<p>Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.</p>
<p><em><strong>Elves.</strong></em> “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Halflings.</strong></em> “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?”</p>
<p><em><strong>Humans.</strong></em> “You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.”</p>

<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p19><h3 id="dwarf-names">Dwarf Names</h3>
<p>A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.</p>

<h3 id="dwarf-traits">Dwarf Traits</h3>
<p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.</p>
<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.</p>
<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<p><em><strong>Dwarven Resilience.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9, “Combat”).</p>
<p><em><strong>Dwarven Combat Training.</strong></em> You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><p><em><strong>Tool Proficiency.</strong></em> You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.</p>
<p><em><strong>Stonecunning.</strong></em> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus</p>
<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.</p>
<p><em><strong>Subrace.</strong></em> Two main subraces of dwarves populate the worlds of D&amp;D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
<h4 id="hill-dwarf">Hill Dwarf</h4>
<p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerûn in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Dwarven Toughness.</strong></em> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>
<h4 id="mountain-dwarf">Mountain Dwarf</h4>
<p>As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerûn, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Dwarven Armor Training.</strong></em> You have proficiency with light and medium armor.</p>

<div class=racial-quote>
<p>“I have never imagined such beauty existed,” Goldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult, but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams. The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled city of Qualinost.</p>
<p>Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glistening spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the city’s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.</p>
<p>— Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman, Dragons of Autumn Twilight</p>
</div>
<p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><div style="height: 300px;"></div>
<h3 id="slender-and-graceful">Slender and Graceful</h3>
<p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>
<p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>
<h3 id="a-timeless-perspective">A Timeless Perspective</h3>
<p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>
<p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-woodland-realms">Hidden Woodland Realms</h3>
<p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with</p>

<div style="height: 300px;" class=wide></div>
<p>outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>
<p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>
<h3 id="exploration-and-adventure">Exploration and Adventure</h3>
<p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="haughty-but-gracious">Haughty but Gracious</h5>
<p>Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious even to those who fall short of their high expectations—which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.</p>
<p><em><strong>Dwarves.</strong></em> “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Halflings.</strong></em> “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Humans.</strong></em> “All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away—human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down and learn some refinement.”</p>

<div class=column-break></div><h3 id="elf-names">Elf Names</h3>
<p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p>
<p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p>

<div class=footnote>Part 1 | Races</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p22><h3 id="elf-traits">Elf Traits</h3>
<p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>
<p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>
<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>
<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<p><em><strong>Keen Senses.</strong></em> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
<p><em><strong>Trance.</strong></em> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>
<p><em><strong>Subrace.</strong></em> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in several subraces: high elves, wood elves. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>
<h4 id="alute-elf">Alute Elf</h4>
<p>As an Alute (or “High”) elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic.  Like the Immortal elves who came before the curse, you are driven to flourish, to create, to discover, and to innovate.  The Alute are, in some ways, the most reclusive of the Elven people; prefering to spend their hours in contemplation of books of lore or philosophy, rather than reaching beyond the borders of Tarudamarë.  As such, Alute are exceptionally rare as adventurers, unless they are <em>Ahúna</em>—or banished from Tarudamarë.</p>
<p>Alute are typically of bronze or alabaster skin, with copper, black, silver, or silver-blue hair.  Their eyes are golden, silver, black, brown, or blue.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Elven Discovery.</strong></em> You have proficiency with one weapon and one tool of your choice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cantrip.</strong></em> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Extra Language.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>
<h4 id="elden-elf">Elden Elf</h4>
<p>The Elden were the immortal elves who came before the curse.  No longer seen, these elves were incredibly inventive and creative, drawn almost instinctively to high magic. Regarded as cruel and capricious, the Elden were the progenitor of many of the common races of Aesl, today; using magical ritual to create and modify races to suit their whim and requirements.  Today, the Elden are believed to be extinct, consumed by the curse of mortality that claimed the Elven people.</p>
<p>The Elden were a diverse people, with skin, hair, and eye colors spanning the spectrum of colors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Eldar Weapon Training.</strong></em> You have proficiency with one melee weapon and one ranged weapon of your choice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Elven Low Magic.</strong></em> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.  When you reach 3rd level, you can cast <em>detect magic</em> once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast <em>alter self</em> once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.  Intelligence  is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
<h4 id="haruma-elf">Haruma Elf</h4>
<p>As an Haruma (or “Wolf”) elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and are one of the rare few who has sought out the ritual of Haruma as a solution to the curse of mortality levied against your people.  Haruma believed that the curse was a means to harness the elven soul, preventing their rebirth.  By merging his soul with a wolf’s, Haruma believed he was able to sidestep the curse, and that upon his death he would avoid the soulcatcher’s fate.  Whether this is true, the Haruma are renowned for their insight and patience, and their ability to become the wolf they have merged with has granted them a talent many elves desire.</p>
<p>Haruma elves were once members of a different subrace, and retain most of the physical characteristics of their past life.  However, most Haruma elves display silver streaks in their hair, and golden flecks in their eyes; characteristics attributed to the wolf spirit that they have merged with.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Shapechanger.</strong></em> You can use your action to polymorph into a wolf. You can revert to your true form, that of an elf, by using a bonus action on your turn. Your statistics, other than listed below, are the same in each form. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for a wolf to wear a piece of equipment, based on its shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new</p>
<div class=footnote>Part 1 | Races</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p23><p>form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the new form has no effect until you leave the form. You revert to your true form if you die.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><em>Bite Attack.</em> While in wolf form, your bite is a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage for a normal unarmed strike. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can only knock a creature prone with your bite attack once per turn.</li>
<li><em>Fast Movement.</em> While in wolf form, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
<li><em>Keen Hearing and Smell.</em> While in wolf form, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</li>
<li><em>Natural Armor.</em> While in wolf form, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Wolf Tongue.</strong></em> Wolves and dogs can understand your speech, and you have the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most wolves and dogs lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you friendship with wolves or dogs, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</p>
<h4 id="lyru-elf">Lyru Elf</h4>
<p>As a Lyru (or “Wild”) elf, your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through the forests native to Tarudamarë.  Your kind prefers to spend its time alone or in small social circles, leading others to believe that you are reclusive and distrusting of others.  This attitude is reinforced by the highly martial nature of the lyru, who have taken on the duty of defending the last home from invasion.</p>
<p>Lyru skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends towards browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Elf Weapon Training.</strong></em> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fleet of Foot.</strong></em> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mask of the Wild.</strong></em> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>
<h4 id="v%C3%ABala-elf">Vëala Elf</h4>
<p>As a Vëala (or “Seaward”) elf, you hear the call of the world beyond Tarudamarë, and yearn to explore it.  Many on the last home consider your kind to be insane or out-of-touch with reality, but that speaks more to their reclusiveness than your actual mental state.  It was the Vëala that established the island of Mahata, where the elven people have begun to trade with the outside world for goods not normally available on the elven homeland.   The Vëala are the most purely artistic of the elven races, and the most likely to try to understand and sympathize with the other races.  By no means does this make them common, but it does mean that if another race has encountered a true elf at all, it was likely one of the Vëala.</p>
<p>Vëala have porcelain skin, sometimes with traces of blue. Their hair tends towards silver, white, and gold, but occasionally traces of green and blue can be found. Their eyes are grey, black, or teal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Instinctive Communication.</strong></em> Using gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with any creature that has a language, and you can understand the gestures and sounds of those creatures, in return.</p>
<p><em><strong>Navigator’s Training.</strong></em> You are proficient in water vehicles.</p>
<p><em><strong>Social Chameleon.</strong></em> You can ignore one source of disadvantage when making a Charisma check.</p>

<div class=racial-quote>
<p>“Life’s too short to let yourself worry over when you’re going to die,” Saia explained with a grin.  “I mean, you could wonder what’s over the next hill until you’re old and grey, but then you’d miss out on all the other things beyond even that!  Let your curiosity drive you, let your excitement guide you, because you <em>are</em> going to die, and the only thing you can control is how much mystery you uncover along the way.”</p>
<p>— Kevin Kragenbrink</p>
</div>
<h2 id="tibbit">Tibbit</h2>
<p>Tibbits (also known as catweres) are small, humanoid creatures that have the ability to turn into a common house cat. They arose from felines kept as familiars in ages past. The powerful magic that allows a familiar to gain intelligence and magic abilities slowly filtered from one generation of cats to the next. Whether tibbits evolved from a natural process, divine intervention, or a sudden surge in the magic running through their ancestry, none can say. Tibbits have never existed in large numbers, and their tendency to spread across the world leaves them with a fractured, incomplete racial history.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><div style="height: 300px;"></div>
<h3 id="independent-observers">Independent Observers</h3>
<p>Much like their feline ancestor, catfolk exhibit independence, curiosity, and quickness of mind and body. They rarely form communities larger than two or three families, and even these small colonies rarely hold together for more than a few years. Shortly after reaching adulthood, a tibbit develops an intense desire to wander the world and satisfy her racial curiosity. Tibbits can be found wherever humans and other civilized humanoid races have established cities, towns, and colonies.</p>
<p>Among humans and other humanoids tibbits usually remain in their cat form. The stray cat that prowls a neighborhood, the mangy cat adopted as a temple’s unofficial pet, and the lazy feline always close at hand at the local tavern might be tibbits. Driven by curiosity, tibbits love to remain in their animal form while observing humans.</p>
<p>Cynical observers contend that a tibbit seeks to spy on others. Tibbits hold that they merely like to keep an ear and eye out for any interesting bits of news. Tibbits are typically too chaotic, carefree, and impulsive to work as spies or hired killers. Upon overhearing a group of adventurers talking over a treasure map in hushed tones, a tibbit might be just as likely to shift into humanoid form on the spot and offer to join the adventure as she is to lose interest and chase down a juicy mouse she spotted across the tavern.</p>
<h3 id="the-lap-of-luxury">The Lap of Luxury</h3>
<p>Tibbits, as befits their heritage, are moody, curious, and sometimes arrogant. Many tibbits prefer the comforts of a fine meal (whether a succulent rodent or a five-course feast in the lap of luxury), stiff drink, and a soft couch. Even the most decadent tibbit, however, eventually succumbs to the steady pull of its curiosity. A tibbit might spend years living off the treasures it won in adventure, only to suddenly strike out into the unknown once again.</p>
<p>When dealing with others, tibbits show a similar capability to change their attitudes and posture depending on their moods. A tibbit might act relaxed and languid one moment, alert and inquisitive the next. They tend to have a slightly distant, arrogant attitude toward others, as if as a race they share a colossal,</p>
<div class=foonote>Part 1 | Races</div>
<div class="pageNumber auto"></div></section><section class=page id=p25><p>secret joke over other intelligent creatures. Still, once a tibbit marks someone as a friend few other creatures match their devotion. A tibbit might complain about a friend’s needs or tend toward laziness, but when trouble arises she is a dauntless ally.</p>
<h3 id="feline-features">Feline Features</h3>
<p>In humanoid form, tibbits are small, stealthy, dark-skinned people with pointed ears and catlike eyes. Their hair tends to grow thick and long and males tend to grow sideburns. Their skin tones range from a tawny brown to black, but occasionally a tibbit has pure white skin. Their hair color matches the wide range of colors found in house cats, from pure white to striped silver to deep black.</p>
<p>In their cat form, tibbits look like fat but energetic house cats. They appear identical to—and indistinguishable from—any common, domesticated breed.</p>
<h3 id="curiouser-and-curiouser">Curiouser and Curiouser</h3>
<p>Tibbits tend to regard other folk with a detached sense of bemusement. Much of their lore and common wisdom regarding men, dwarves, and elves filters through their guise as house cats. Thus, tibbits see how other races act when they think no one else is around. To a tibbit, every intelligent creature is a bundle of secrets just waiting to unfurl before them.</p>
<p>In general, tibbits find humanity’s ambition, drive, and fiery passion intriguing. They consider dwarves overly dour. Elves strike them as kindred spirits, as tibbits appreciate that the long-lived races share a similar tendency to see issues from different perspectives. They adore gnomes and halflings and many good-aligned tibbits adopt such folk. More than one kobold or goblin party has descended upon a sleepy gnome village or halfling caravan only to find an enraged tibbit wizard waiting for them. Gnome and halfling folk who have benefited from such welcome surprises have strong traditions of taking care of stray cats and treating their feline pets as treasured companions.</p>
<div class=column-break></div><h3 id="natural-explorers">Natural Explorers</h3>
<p>Tibbits have no lands of their own. Instead, they dwell within civilized territories established by other folk. Any civilization that keeps domesticated cats likely houses colonies of tibbits within its cities.</p>
<p>Few tibbits make their identity openly known once they settle in an area. A tibbit is much more likely to remain in cat form as she travels through a city, although she usually keeps a well-hidden, luxurious apartment hidden in an out-of-the-way corner of town. Many tibbits become petty thieves, raiding pantries for fine foods, liquor, and other creature comforts.</p>
<p>Tibbits who travel the land might keep their humanoid guise to make dealings with other creatures easier. Even these tibbits prefer to pass themselves off as travelers from other planes, and they rarely publicize their ability to change shape.</p>
<h3 id="tibbit-names">Tibbit Names</h3>
<p>Tibbits tend to adopt names based on their physical traits and deeds. A tibbit kitten is given a nickname by her parents or her master, one that reflects her temperament and appearance. When a tibbit comes of age she adopts a name of her choice. Tibbits tend to pick names from other folk, usually based solely on the sound.</p>
<p>Strangers and business partners use the name a tibbit picks for herself, while the tibbit’s close friends and family use the original nickname chosen by her parents. A tibbit allows only her closest friends to learn and use her nickname. A nontibbit given such a privilege has received one of the highest honors a tibbit can grant to an outsider.</p>
<p>As a tibbit travels the world, she adopts a surname that reflects her experiences and important deeds. A tibbit usually changes her surname after such an event, but her true name uses all of her adopted surnames from childhood onward, and not just her latest one. When two tibbits meet, they share these long-form names to express their pasts with one another.</p>
<p>In general, tibbit names work for either sex. Whether male or female, a tibbit who has a short tail in cat form likely ends up with the nickname “Spiketail.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Parent-Bestowed Names:</strong></em> Blackpaw, Glittereye, Longear, Patchfur, Quickfang, Tumblepaw.</p>

</section><section class=page id=p26><h3 id="adventurous">Adventurous</h3>
<p>The life of an adventurer comes naturally to a tibbit, as her curiosity pushes her ever onward. While many tibbits satisfy this drive with travel to civilized areas and exploration of a city’s corners, some tibbits want more out of life. “Adventurer” is seen as a respected occupation among tibbits, and they have a natural fascination for adventurers of other races. In some cases, a tibbit in cat form takes to following an adventuring band, concealing its true nature until an opportune moment. A tibbit fighter might spring from cat to humanoid form in time to drive off a group of orcs that threatens the party’s camp. In this manner, tibbits prove their valor and demonstrate their unmatched stealth in hopes of winning a place with their unwitting comrades.</p>
<h3 id="tibbit-traits">Tibbit Traits</h3>
<p>Your tibbit character has a number of traits in common with all other tibbits.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> A tibbit reaches adulthood at the age of 16, and generally lives into the middle of his second or third century.</p>
<p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Tibbits have a strong tendency toward chaos and an equally strong lethargy toward moral issues, making the majority of them chaotic neutral. Carefree, decadent, and given to long periods of wallowing in luxury, tibbits can be maddeningly self-centered. Some tibbits tend toward proactive freedom-seeking, marking chaotic good as their second most common alignment. Such tibbits share many of their neutral brethren’s tendencies, but a righteous struggle or a chance to spring a trap on evildoers rouses them to action.</p>
<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Tibbits average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is small.</p>
<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Escape Artist.</strong></em> Tibbits have advantage on checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple or the restrained condition.</p>
<p><em><strong>Feline Transformation.</strong></em> You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a house cat. You can remain in this form indefinitely, and only revert to your natural form when you are rendered unconscious. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of a cat, but you retain your hit points, alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies.</li>
<li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to those actions which a cat may take. Transforming does not break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.</li>
<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if a cat is physically capable of doing so.</li>
<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for a cat to wear a piece of equipment, based on its shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the new form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Keen Senses.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in Perception.</p>
<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and you can speak and understand Feline. The Feline language, a strange combination of purrs, hisses, and empathic transfers, allows tibbits to communicate with cats of all forms. Tibbits are born with the knowledge of this language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Naturally Stealthy.</strong></em> You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Subrace.</strong></em> The two main kinds of tibbits, alley cats and domestics, refer more to whether the tibbit was raised in a Wizard’s tower, or on the streets.</p>
<h4 id="alley-cat">Alley Cat</h4>
<p>As an Alley Cat, you have lived your life largely as one of exploration and curiosity, unfettered by any master or calling. You’re inclined to boldness, independence, and perhaps a bit of overconfidence.</p>
<p>Alley Cats are more prone to wander than other tibbits, rarely settling in one place for long as they constantly seek a better patch of sunlight to rest in.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Free Spirit.</strong></em> You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>
<p><em><strong>Scavenger:</strong></em> Starvation is no stranger; you require food half as often as a normal character.</p>
<h4 id="domestic">Domestic</h4>
<p>As a domestic, you were raised in the care of a wizard. You learned to respect his studious nature, and were well cared for during most of the days. Your master’s constant thirst for knowledge only fueled your own curiosity, granting you insight into secrets other tibbits wish they understood, and your constant exposure to magic gave you an inherent resistance to it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Arcane Infusion.</strong></em> You know the <em>prestidigitation</em> cantrip.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Art of Laziness.</strong></em> You are used to taking short naps throughout the day whenever you can get the opportunity. You are able to complete a short rest in half the time, and after resting for at least 4 hours throughout the course of a day, you can gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. You may still only benefit from one long rest in any twenty-four hour period.</p>
